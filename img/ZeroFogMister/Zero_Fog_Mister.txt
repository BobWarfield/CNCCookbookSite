=================================================================


I've used a mister for many years on both lathes and mills. I 
hate the mess of flood coolant leaking all over the floor and 
mist cooling gives about 90% of the benefit. The major problem 
with mist cooling is fogging or atomizing the coolant so fine 
it floats around in the shop. Since I'm running a machine many 
hours a day, I've gotten real sensitive to the fog - it gives 
me a sore throat.

Anyway, I read about a low fog mister called a HenchForth Fog 
Buster here on this NG. A fellow had obtained a copy of the 
patent for this unit and made his own. So, I did the same. This 
unit was better, but still a slight fog or smell of coolant 
would be in the shop. But,it gave me the idea of how to build 
a better one. This unit works so well, you can't tell its on - 
no sign of fog or odor of mist.

The key to operation is in the relative pressure of the coolant 
and the supply air pressure. A standard mister has the coolant 
unpressurized and uses 40 - 60 psi air. The Hench unit pressurizes 
the coolant container to the same pressure air the air line. This 
unit uses a higher air pressure for the coolant than the air line.

A short explanation of construction:

1. Build a coolant container out of an old 20 lb. propane tank. 
Make a removable top to refill coolant (just a 1/2" pipe plug). 
Weld in a drain line connection to the bottom of the tank. Provide 
a way to use a regulator and air line to pressurize the tank to 
20 PSI. The drain line goes to the mister as a pressurized coolant 
supply.

2. Provide an air supply regulated to 5 psi. Make a way to shut off 
both this line and the coolant line when the mister is not needed.

3.The mister unit joins the water line and the air line with a needle 
valve to control the amount of coolant delivered. Use a small block 
of brass to make this assembly. The air line passes through the block 
and must be necked down to 0.100 " dia. so the air velocity is high. 
At this point, the coolant line intersects the air line. The coolant 
line must be very small, I used 0.040 " dia. at this point. Just 
upstream from where the coolant enters, there must be a needle valve 
to regulate coolant flow rate. I just soldered in a McMaster needle 
valve - 48965K24. 

4. Use a 6" long  1/8" OD brass tube for the mister extension shaft. 
To the send of this solder a nozzle. This must be 0.75" long and have 
an inside diameter of 0.040".


Again, this unit is a total success for me. It runs up to six hours a 
day with absolutely no fogging. Mist rate can be controlled from nearly 
nothing to a heavy, nearly flood mist.
