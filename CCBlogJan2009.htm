      <p class="BlogTitle">It Lives! (Got my X and Y axes running on the mill 
        this morning)</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between the wee hours Friday 
        night and the morning today I've gotten the X and Y axis servos mounted 
        and running. The servos are really not tuned yet, but even in their rough 
        state I was able to move the table at 180 IPM! I am not suggesting that 
        is something that will be accurate or even usable, it was just play, but 
        it was fun! I tried for 200 IPM, but the servos started faulting again 
        and I didn't want to spend too much time tuning for a scenario that isn't 
        real anyway.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, I added <a href="CCMillCNCServos.html">a 
        new page</a> that gathers up all the stuff I had to do to adapt the HomeshopCNC 
        servos to the IH Mill CNC Kit.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My next problem 
        is to adapt the servo for the Z-axis, which is going to require a little 
        stronger medicine:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My goal for this weekend was 
        to have the enclosure mounted on the rolling tool cabinet and be able 
        to spin all three servo motors. Easier said than done!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mounting the enclosure was 
        pretty easy, as was installing the electronics and axis modules. Here 
        are some shots of how things looked just now when I was downstairs in 
        the garage:</font></p>

        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Very messy wiring. 
        After I get everything working, I'll be milling new panels (using this 
        CNC mill of course) and I'll take that opportunity to build some real 
        wiring harnesses that clean this up!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wiring is 
        pretty messy, but I'll be rejiggering it to make some real wiring harnesses 
        and clean it up on a future pass. Right now I just want to make it work. 
        Most of my difficulties have been with the C17 card and getting it to 
        reliably deal with servo faults. I haven't yet decided whether the board 
        is flaky, or whether I'm just using it wrong. I do know I have seen it 
        do some pretty odd things. When I got everything into this cabinet, for 
        example, it completely quit closing the relay during the startup sequence. 
        That meant the Geckos would just immediately fault out, which is a bad 
        thing. If you read my diagnosis page, you'll see I keep having this problem 
        over and over. Each time the fix is a little different. This time I got 
        things going again by connecting the switched side of the Start button 
        to the DC supply relay. That ensures it gets closed during the Start cycle 
        regardless of what the C17 chooses to do. As is usual for me, I didn't 
        think of this solution until after I'd slept overnight from a frustrating 
        earlier session. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I've got all 
        3 servos spinning. X tends to fault out, but that's just because I don't 
        have the servos in a very good state of tune. There's liittle point in 
        it until I can get them mounted on the machine anyway because they'll 
        just need returning. Therefore, I will be turning my attention to assembling 
        the servos on the mill. I plan to mount the timing pulleys onto the servo 
        shafts using 1/8&quot; roll pins. This is how IH does it on their turnkey 
        systems and it'll be a lot more solid than trying to use setscrews on 
        the powerful motors I've got. Towards that end, I was researching the 
        proper hole sizes to drill and came across a page from SDP-SI on it <a href="http://www.sdp-si.com/D790/PDF/D790C10060.pdf">here</a>.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Axis Modules 
        Are Done Pending 2 Cables</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All three axis modules are 
        now assembled and tested. As I was finalizing the last of the three modules, 
        I decided I wanted a quick disconnect on the signal wires, so I made up 
        a cable out of a male and female DB9, and that looks like it will work 
        well. I just need to make 2 more of those cables for use with the other 
        2 axis modules.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is what a finished module 
        looks like with the quick disconnect:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Enclosure/P1010988.jpg" width="1024" height="657"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To install an 
        axis module in the enclosure requires 2 connections--the quick connect 
        is all the signal level stuff, and then there are the main DC power supply 
        + and - that go to bus bars. It should be pretty quick and easy to install 
        one or switch one with another to clear up some issue. I could've skipped 
        the quick connect, but I got to thinking about poking and prodding inside 
        that enclosure on my hands and knees and wanted to make it easier.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's next?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Planning 
        Two More Axis Modules</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got the last issue figured 
        out with the prototype <a href="CCMillCNCAxisModule.htm">axis module</a>. 
        I had been manually reseting the startup fault on the Geckodrive. They 
        start in a faulted state until you bring the Err/Res line high. So I was 
        just touching a jumper to the Enc+ terminal to do that. For the finished 
        system, the CNC4PC Master Control Board is supposed to handle that function. 
        Initially, I was having a problem getting it to work properly, but it 
        turned out to be due to the fact I hadn't grounded the Enc- to the same 
        ground the CNC4PC board was expecting to use as its reference. As soon 
        as I did that, I started to get reliable behavior.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following that troubleshooting 
        effort, I spent some time reviewing where the prototype stood and making 
        a wiring diagram to use as a guide with the other axis modules. I want 
        to clean up the wiring from the current cat's cradle to something a little 
        more manageable. I also wanted to make sure I was grounding all the cable 
        shields to keep noise out of the system. Servo systems are extremely sensitive 
        to noise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I now have a plan for how to 
        wire the remaining two modules. I will also make some very minor changes 
        in the original module to bring it to the same spec as the two additional 
        modules. I can't do the wiring tonight, so hopefully I'll get a free evening 
        next week and then I can be spinning all three servo motors at once!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After that I still have a fair 
        amount of work to do, but the path to getting the mill up and running 
        will look something like this:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Finish wiring and testing 
        3 axis modules.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Drill mounting holes for 
        the axis modules and front and rear panels in the enclosure. Clean up 
        the enclosure of all remaining chips and other debris.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Drill the mounting holes 
        to mount the enclosure on the rolling cart.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Paint the enclosure IH blue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Install the electronics in 
        the enclosure, button up, and test again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Install 3 servos on the mill. 
        Note that this involves a little machine work on the X and Y timing pulleys 
        for set screws.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Final cleanup and testing 
        of the CNC electronics and servos. Includes servo tuning and other parameter 
        fine tuning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Install head on the mill</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Done!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's getting close, but there's 
        still a lot of work to be done. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Why CNC for 
        a Home Shop?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a good discussion 
        over on HMEM where someone asks why anyone would want CNC for a home shop. 
        Their shop instructor told them that for less than 3 identical parts, 
        manual machining could do it faster and cheaper. Here was my response:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, I would not want to 
        undertake CNC unless:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - I had a decent knowledge 
        of manual machining. How to measure, what the cutting should sound like, 
        how to judge if I'm going too fast and so on. You lose all &quot;touch&quot; 
        with CNC and have to be able to rely on your experience more IMHO. As 
        a home machinist, you can't just be the &quot;button presser&quot; on 
        your CNC. You are the designer, the one who comes up with the fixtures, 
        and all the rest. Solid manual machining experience is a good background 
        for that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - I was comfortable with computers 
        being a lot bigger part of my shop experience. This is inescapable when 
        you go to CNC. In particular, you will have to deal with CAD, certainly 
        the machine control (Mach3, for example), and possibly CAM software or 
        g-code programming.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - I was comfortable poking 
        and prodding my way through making the electricals work. There are a lot 
        of electricals with CNC, and if you have a hard time changing a light 
        bulb, you don't want to be dealing with the frustrations of a CNC system. 
        This doesn't mean you need to be able to do component-level diagnosis 
        of circuit boards, but you should be handy with a voltmeter and reading 
        a circuit diagram. Like any machine, the CNC will break sooner or later 
        and you'll have to fix it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Second, I don't buy the instructor's 
        notion that CNC doesn't &quot;break even&quot; until you need to make 
        several copies of a part. There are a lot of advantages of CNC that are 
        apparent very quickly if you have even a little bit of proficiency:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - It requires less tooling. 
        By the time you pay for a nice DRO and power feeds on all three axes you 
        can just about pay for CNC. Not quite, but close. Add up all the other 
        tooling you may have that is no longer required for CNC and CNC will be 
        cheaper. But, you'd need to pay that bill up front, so it may not matter. 
        Also, to take full advantage, you may need to buy a CAM program so you 
        don't have to g-code it all by hand. That gets REALLY expensive and will 
        eliminate most of the cost savings if not all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - You can do things that just 
        aren't possible or would be very hard with manual machining. Complex flowing 
        curves and engraving are two examples. We have ball turners for lathes, 
        but profiling such shapes and much more complex ones is trivial with CNC. 
        Also, there are operations that a really talented manual machinist can 
        do that I can't do manually, but can easily do with CNC. There is less 
        of a burden on you, the machinist, to develop that fine art, but you will 
        be called on to develop other fine arts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - CNC can be faster. The CNC 
        can whip out operations a lot faster than I can, at any rate. A big part 
        of my impetus is this productivity. I simply can't build everything I 
        want to build in my shop fast enough eith the hours available to me. If 
        I invest some of those hours up front in a CNC conversion, I can get more 
        projects done later.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - Surface finish and precision 
        can go way up with CNC. Did you experience an immediate improvement in 
        surface finish when you got a power feed for your mill? I did. Can you 
        hand feed on your lathe and get as good a finish as with the power feed? 
        It's really hard for me, and the results are not always reliable. Now 
        imagine if you could dial in the perfect speeds and feeds for every operation 
        via CNC. In fact, through features like CSS, the machine will even vary 
        the lathe spindle speed as you move towards the axis to ensure that perfect 
        cutting speed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Let's end my post by considering 
        some photos. Here is a set of CNC'd pulleys hot of the machine: </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/croppedpulleys.jpg" width="800" height="533"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Note the surface finish. How 
        easily can you get that manually? Sure, some part of it is the radically 
        better rigidity of the machine used, but some part is also the perfect 
        feeds and speeds concept I mentioned. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now consider a more typical 
        HSM project, an upright marine style multiple expansion steam engine. 
        This one was done in a home shop with CNC by jimmibondi (Frank) that won 
        the <a href="http://www.homemodelenginemachinist.com/index.php?topic=3289.0">HMEM 
        November Engine of the Month</a>:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Steam/MachineFinal.jpg" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will venture to say that 
        it wouldn't take me three copies of it for this masterpiece to get done 
        a lot faster and better with CNC than manual machining. Not that you couldn't 
        do it manually, and not that it didn't require incredible craftsmanship 
        to do with CNC, but it would just take a lot longer manually.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With all that said, manual 
        machining is tremendous fun and CNC is not for everyone. It's a hobby, 
        do what you like!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Major Milestone: 
        Spinning a Servo! (When Debugging, Whatever Can Go Wrong Will Go Wrong)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just now got 1 servo spinning 
        on the bench after 2 1/2 days of trial and error debugging. If you want 
        the full story of how I debugged this silling thing, I captured it <a href="CCMillCNCDebugging.htm">on 
        a page</a> so you can see how I went about it. It's a painful process 
        as not all of the relevant information you will need is captured in one 
        single place. Some of it was out there, but a lot of it I just had to 
        figure out on my own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a concise list of all 
        the things I had to change from my original attempt to run:</font></p>
      <p> 
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set CNC4PC Master Control 
          Board DIP switches for G320. It acts funny on the other board types 
          whether or not Err/Res is connected.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discovered I had mislabeled 
          the leads from my front panel for the &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;E-stop&quot;, 
          so they were connected backwards.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reverse the motor connections 
          because they were backwards compared to what the encoder indicated, 
          causing an immediate servo fault.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In doing #3, I reversed 
          the wrong leads and had to replace the power supply rectifier. I don't 
          think I blew the Gecko, amazingly!</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Connect a 47K ohm resistor 
          across pins 1 and 3 of the G320 to ensure the bridge initializes properly. 
          This was buried in a hard to find Mariss note on CNCZone.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I was getting the servo 
          to hold position, so I played with the tuning trimpots a bit.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Mach3, set Step/Dir to 
          ActiveLo. Set pulse width to 5 (the pulse width may be ignored for Smoothstepper).</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Connect &quot;Common&quot; 
          on G320 to +5V on breakout card instead of Ground. Another one that's 
          easy to miss unless you read a lot of posts on various boards!</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set up the proper motor 
          tuning parameters on Mach3. IH says 115 IPM speed and 0.15g of acceleration, 
          according to another post I found. I also needed 28,240 steps to move 
          1&quot;.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set the Smoothstepper jumpers 
          to actually provide +5V to the breakout board. Otherwise, the terminals 
          marked &quot;+5V&quot; are 0V!</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I can spin the servo this 
        way and that with Mach3. It can still fault if I rapidly change directions 
        at full jog, but that's just tuning and I need to set it properly on the 
        actual machine instead of with servos flopping around on the floor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I must admit that per the discussion 
        on the Cookbook Blog on the Eternal Servo vs Stepper Jihad, it was a lot 
        harder to spin a servo than a stepper. In general, I encountered a lot 
        of less than obvious things including the CNC4PC DIP switch settings, 
        need for the 47K ohm resistor (that's going to be built into the next 
        generation Gecko servo drives), and bizarre experiences with &quot;Common&quot;, 
        which has to be +5V, and which didn't get +5V until the Smoothstepper 
        jumpers were enabled.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some photos of my 
        CNC electronics testing lab on the dining room table (my wife is glad 
        it seems to be working and I'm cursing a lot less!):</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">The Eternal 
        Servo vs Stepper Jihad Continues</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a number of &quot;Jihads&quot; 
        in the machinist's world including the indexable carbide tooling versus 
        hand ground HSS tooling debate, and this debate over the value of servos 
        versus steppers in small CNC machines. I have used both and wrote a response 
        when this subject came up <a href="http://www.homemodelenginemachinist.com/index.php?topic=3558.msg37926;topicseen#new">over 
        on the HMEM board</a> recently. I thought I would pass along that response 
        here so the points would be preserved:</font></p>
      <p> 
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Aha, the sacred Servo/Stepper/Open Loop/Closed Loop Jihad has made 
          it here! </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have both. There are good 
          arguments for both. In the end, I have a hard time not going for the 
          servos if I can afford it. Just as we can say NASA used stepper-based 
          systems back in the day so therefore steppers are good, we can also 
          say there are almost no stepper-based VMC's made today, so therefore 
          servos are better. In fact, the servos way outperform steppers in most 
          cases, they just cost more, and you may not need (or be able to take 
          advantage of) that extra performance. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can argue that we don't 
          care about that extra performance, and we may not, but let's not kid 
          ourselves that there isn't even the <i>potential</i> for the performance 
          or that it won't matter to <i>anyone</i>. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree with most of what 
          kf2qd says, but I don't agree on the cost point. A servo-based system 
          is more expensive, but it isn't $1000 per axis!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, my IH Mill runs 
          homeshopcnc servo motors at a cost of $235 (I got the fancier ones, 
          but they have one with encoder for $199 if you're pinching pennies) 
          for 850 oz in motors, which are pretty stout. Equivalent stepper motor 
          might be $130 from the same place, so you save circa $69, the cost of 
          the encoder. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Add a Gecko servo drive 320 
          at $114, which is the same price as a Gecko 201 stepper drive, so no 
          incremental cost there. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last servo specific piece 
          I use is a board from CNC4PC called the "Master Control Board". It manages 
          the servo fault signals from the Geckodrive and costs $48. You wouldn't 
          really need one with a stepper system, although it could be used to 
          manage your E-stop and limit switches. The nice thing it does for servo 
          users is it manages servo fault signals so that a servo fault looks 
          like an E-stop. What does that mean? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A servo fault happens when 
          the encoder indicates that the motor hasn't been keeping up with the 
          commands issued by Mach 3. On a Gecko 320, the fault is triggered if 
          the encoder falls more than 128 steps behind the commanded position. 
          For my IH mill, each step is 0.7 of a tenth, so an error of 128 means 
          that axis is off by about 9 thousandths. Note that this will differ 
          based on the leadscrew pitch, encoder counts, and belt drive ratios 
          for your machine, but it gives you an idea. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice what happens 
          is, I run the CNC program, and if the servos don't fault, I know I was 
          within 9 thousands, and probably a lot better, of what the program intended. 
          Equally as important if not more so, the program may have gotten off 
          by nearly 9 thousandths at some point, but with a servo system, it can 
          "catch back up", so the error is localized and doesn't carry through 
          all subsequent moves. If I was running a stepper system, I might be 
          off by a lot more, and the errors become cumulative. Once I'm off, the 
          system never catches back up again. In fact, if I start a whole new 
          part without rezeroing, the error lives on for the new part too! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the servo fault, I can 
          see by where the machine stopped what it was doing when the error added 
          up to too much. It's pretty easy to turn down the feedrate (potentially 
          just for that part of the program and not the whole program too), restart 
          the program, and try again. If the same happens for the stepper, I have 
          to start measuring the part to find where the error begins manually. 
          I may not even be able to measure the beginnings, because they may have 
          been machined off. In fact, with the stepper, I have no idea if there 
          error is due to lost steps or some other source of error in the machine. 
          This makes tuning up your programs a lot harder with a stepper system 
          than a servo system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be ideal if the 
          controller could actually log where the errors occurred, how far off 
          things got, and even let me set in software the servo fault limit (maybe 
          I want to fault if its off by more than a thou, or perhaps I'd like 
          to be able to change that tolerance at different places in the program). 
          It's be even better if the position signal made the control dynamically 
          slow down or otherwise take steps to "do better". I can't really do 
          that with the rig I describe. I can do a little better with the Rogers 
          board, but it isn't clear to me how to make that board work without 
          even more encoders. It's more of an add on to a stepper system. It's 
          probably not possible at this stage in Mach 3 development to do what 
          I describe at all, but what I do get seems pretty good to me. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice, I suspect steppers 
          lose steps a lot more often than most stepper users think. Many people 
          complain that the Gecko 320 is "too sensitive" to servo fault. Given 
          that the fault doesn't happen until they are off a few thou at least 
          and maybe more, those same people are obviously used to running stepper 
          systems that silently get off by that much and keep going. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It can get a lot worse too. 
          Servo faults can be caused because the program runs awry and the cutter 
          is plowing into vises, clamps, tables, and whatever else gets in the 
          way. The stepper will keep chugging through it even after the cutter 
          breaks and there is a smoking ruin. It isn't going to take too much 
          of that sort of thing before the servo will fault and things stop. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So to conclude this rather 
          long essay, do I insist only on servos? No, not at all. I have two machines 
          set up for steppers and one for servos. I'm happy with each. I'm just 
          saying that if I can afford the added expense of servos, I think they're 
          better in every way. I don't see a down side to them other than the 
          cost. That cost is quantifiable. On my mill, it has cost me an extra 
          $210 to buy 3 servos instead of 3 stepper motors, and another $48 for 
          the Master Control Board. I think the extra $258 was well worth it on 
          t</font>his mill. Your mileage may vary! </p>

        makes some excellent points that are a good addition to my post:</font></p>
      <p> 
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>First a couple of clarifications. </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes the Bridgeport's did 
          have massive steppers on them, got loads lying about here and they were 
          only 850 to 1200 oz in on a type 42 motor. Modern type 34 can piss all 
          over these so it's not the motors. the Bridgy controller / driver unit 
          was absolute crap. This is the reason why there are so many good mills 
          out there, they never wore out because they spent more time broken down, 
          crash one into something and it burnt the output transistors out - full 
          stop. They were only full stepping and could hold 0,001" but even in 
          those days 1 thou to NASA was still the same thou it is today. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob put some good points 
          about the difference between steppers and servo's and I have no beef 
          with his explanations, they are 100%. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One point that has been missed 
          though and lets face it this IS a hobby forum is the skills needed to 
          built both systems. Steppers are cheap and simple easy to mount usually 
          on existing hardware as they develop maximum torque at low revs. Servo's 
          develop max torque at high revs meaning you have to gear an axis down 
          to get any sort of power out of it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Quoting max feed rates isn't 
          everything in CNC as any G00 moves are not cutting and only costing 
          you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main difference for a 
          beginner is the complexity of the servo system. There are not many good 
          servo drivers out there for one and all rely on encoder feedback, to 
          a beginner this often also translates to noise. Read the CAD_CAM_DRO 
          list, Gecko list and CNC Zone and most of the beginners problems are 
          caused by electrical noise. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also a missing link 
          at the moment in that the larger servo motors require analogue inputs 
          but affordable controllers use step and direction, Gecko drives can't 
          power the big servo's like the BOSS 2's and Mach can't power the larger 
          Fanuc, Baldor and Siemens servo's drives. Rutex tried and failed, the 
          Pixie convertor card whist seeming to work was withdrawn so there is 
          a gap. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CNC like any new venture 
          is a steep learning curve and the sooner it flattens out the sooner 
          you actually start learning and enjoying. Doing a simple stepper system 
          to cut your teeth on and then progress if far better than throwing yourself 
          into the top end, never getting a grasp of it and then feeling let down. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incidentally my big mill, 
          a Beaver, the same size as a BOSS 2 and built with the same stepper 
          motors as the BOSS 1's at 850 ox in direct onto 0.2" pitch ballscrews 
          has been running all day today drilling circular hole patterns with 
          a 2.5mm drill. These holes are virtually touching and any errors show 
          up immediately, add to this the machine has graduated dials on as it 
          shared some components with it's manual stablemate so when it goes home 
          it's easily checked. Todays run was 11,208 holes and it's parked back 
          on 0,0,0 two drill used, tomorrow it will be doing the same but different 
          job and on 3.12mm holes.</font></p>

        on John's comments, which I stated on the board, is that it may be better

        John is worried about. </font></p>

        is a little beefier. I'm glad I did an Epoxy Granite fill on my IH; I'll 
        bet it's beefier still! I'm also glad I've got those big ole hockey puck 
        leveling feet to help me adjust. OTOH, I may just find my base is so stiff 
        that shimming it won't adjust a twist out at all and I'll need to shim 
        the column instead!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Shim or No 
        Shim for Twist on Lathes and Mills</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One sure way to ignite a controversy 
        is to bring up the topic of leveling as it relates to out of square lathes 
        and mills. There is a school that says you level the lathe's bed and the 
        rest is a function of the machine itself. There is another school that 
        wants to use level as &quot;close to correct&quot; and then run a test 
        bar with further adjustment of the leveling until the lathe cuts without 
        taper. The first school sees this as adding a twist to the bed and is 
        horrified. The second school sees it as a practical solution to a problem 
        and wonders whether the first school realizes that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently the same sort of argument 
        broke out around milling machines, specifically the Tormach. <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tormach1100/message/3604">It's 
        an interesting thread</a>, with both sides weighing in. Philbur addresses 
        the purest camp clearly with this remark:</font></p>
      <p> 
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <blockquote>I think that shimming the bed must be the last resort, not the 
        first, for correcting a tram error. Tramming the table tells you that 
        the spindle is not perpendicular to the table surface (assuming the surface 
        is flat!), it doesn't tell you why. The column may not be square to the 
        table, or the spindle may not be square to the column, or both. Twisting 
        the bed will most probably mask one error by introducing a second error. 
        The correct method is to identify each error individually and correct 
        it without influencing any other alignments. </blockquote>
      </font> 
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OTOH, no less an authority 
        than Tormach's Greg Jackson himself says to shim the base instead of the 
        column:</font></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When working to optimize 
          the left/right tram, shimming the front left or right feet under the 
          base is always the first thing to do. The natural assumption is that 
          the stand should be flat and rigid, then you put the machine on it and 
          everything is perfect. The reality of the world is that everything is 
          flexible, even those things that appear rigid. The stand is less rigid 
          than the base of the mill itself and when the 1100 lb mill is placed 
          on the stand, the stand moves a few thousandths of an inch in reaction 
          to the weight of the mill. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Machine geometry can seem 
          straightforward, but it becomes complex when you start to understand 
          the fine details. If you take a perfect machine an put it on a stand 
          which flexes in a non linear fashion under the weight of the machine, 
          then there will be some left/right tram error due to a small twist force 
          on the base. Countering that twist force by shimming the base/column 
          connection point is possible but shimming between the base/stand is 
          easier and probably a more accurate way to correct. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The iron base of the mill 
          goes through both a heat soak stress relief and a vibration stress relief 
          process so residual stresses are unlikely. The stand is a welded fabrication 
          and will always have some residual internal stresses. If some alignment 
          issues show up over time it could be the result of a crash, motion in 
          the iron, or motion in the steel stand. We believe the stand is the 
          most likely source. In the actual manufacturing process each machine 
          base is checked on a large surface plate before the machine is assembled. 
          Assembly and test is not done on a surface plate, but the rather on 
          a three point stance. Instead of sitting on the four corners of the 
          iron base, the machine rests on the back two corners and a round bar 
          in the center front. Since three points determine a plane, this approach 
          ensures that there are no stresses introduced in the machine base during 
          the final test. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm with Jackson on this one 
        from a practical standpoint, although he has sent me correspondence claiming 
        that all problems with out of squareness can be traced to a stand that 
        is not level, something I don't agree with. It may be that the base is 
        fine and the column could be shimmed, but if you can do it from the base, 
        that seems an easier/better approach. If nothing else, try it that way 
        first and take some measurements with your DTI to see how close you're 
        coming. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also note that for this to 
        work out well, you can't bolt the machine to the stand. What you're doing 
        is using leveling feet on the base to jack one corner or another, so the 
        base has to be able to rise and fall relative to the stand.</font></p>

        Surface Finish Tips When Milling</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep a fine finish pass. 
          Use a different cutter than you roughed with for best finish.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep your finish and rouging 
          cutters separated. If you use the same type of cutter for both, start 
          new cutters as finish cutters and move them to roughing after a little 
          while. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the finish is down a 
          hole, relieve the upper cutting surface so it won't be in contact with 
          the hole and just cut at the bottom. This will reduce chatter, and works 
          well when profiling with ball nosed end mills as well.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use a larger diameter cutter, 
          if possible, as it will flex less.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep the gibs tighter for 
          less chatter.</font></li>

          for the finish pass. By the time you're ready to finish, there should 
          be ample room for chips to fly and the extra flutes and light depth 
          of cut will make for a nicer finish (the equivalent of more spindle 
          rpm with a 2 flute).</font></li>

          3 flute cutters on aluminum.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Balance the diameter of 
          a ball end cutter versus the rigidity. Remember, the part of the ball 
          near the axis moves slowly. A smaller ball interpolated exposes more 
          of the surface to a faster moving cutter, leading to a better finish. 
          But, the smaller cutter can flex more. Hence the need to balance these 
          two factors.</font></li>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Stabilizing 
        a Round Column Mill Drill</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have not been a fan of the 
        round column mill drills because every time you raise or lower the head, 
        it can rotate a little on the column. This means you lose your position 
        every time you move the head. When I think about how often I crank the 
        head up and down on my Industrial Hobbies mill, the idea of this seems 
        extremely painful. I'd be tempted to go with one of the little Sieg mills 
        of less capacity rather than deal with it. Nevertheless, these mills are 
        quite popular, they are cheap, and a lot of very fine work has been done 
        with them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are some potential solutions 
        to the weakness of head rotation. First, I have seen cases of fixing a 
        laser to the head and using it to align. If you can align the spot on 
        a wall 20 feet away to a precision of 0.100&quot;, your head will be accurately 
        positioned to just under a thousandth. Mind you, I'd be tempted to use 
        a wall 10 feet away and a reflector to put the laser spot somewhere close 
        to the mill, but it could be done.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another approach involves physically 
        changing the mill's structure to hold the alignment. I recently came across 
        <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=70099">a fascinating 
        thread in CNCZone </a>where a fellow has built a wishbone stabilizer for

        shows an indicator in the chuck being run up and down a straightedge to 
        test how accurately the head is held by the wishbone stabilizer. He says 
        it swings as much as 10 thousandths while cranking but settles back down 
        to 3 or 4 thousandths at the end. That's not bad. I'll bet there is a 
        lot of play in the ball joints and there should be a way to build a little 
        stronger wishbone that would be even more accurate. Nice write up!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a couple of great 
        tips here. Aside from aligning the part in the chuck with the ball bearing, 
        the use of circular pieces instead of a dovetail on the QCTP is also quite 
        interesting. It also looks like he keeps that indicator on a permanent 
        holder on the lathe's backsplash where it is handy to get to.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can be forgiven if you 
        don't think I've been doing anything for 3 weeks. Reallity is I've actually 
        been pretty busy. It takes a ridiculous amount of research to figure out 
        how to wire up one of these CNC projects right, so that's a big part of 
        what I've been doing. Ordering various ancillary parts and mounting my 
        various little sub-circuit boards to a big mounting plate that goes in 
        the enclosure would be the other part. Today I got started wiring up. 
        I want to do just enough wiring to verify I can spin one servo sitting 
        on the bench before I do too much else. </font></p>

        Hoss, you owe it to yourself to check out <a href="http://www.hossmachine.info/">his 
        web site</a> and <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=30385&amp;page=53">postings 
        on CNCZone</a>. He is one of the most inspirational (if not THE most inspirational) 
        CNC &quot;hobbyists&quot; I've come across. Aside from the guys that build 
        cool machines from scratch, there isn't much that Hoss hasn't done. His 
        Sieg X2 has been transformed into a hobbyist vertical machining center. 
        He built a rotary tool changer, flood coolant enclosure, and many other 
        add-ons until it has become an incredible little machine. When I need 
        a fresh shot of inspiration to get off the video games and get back into 
        machine work, I just watch a few of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hossmachine">his 
        YouTube videos</a> and I am fired up and ready to go.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The latest thing he has done 
        that caught my eye is this endmill sharpening rig:</font></p>

        perfectly. Looks like it got real sharp too!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Home Shop Machinists 
        are always interested in tool and cutter grinding for some reason. I agree 
        T&amp;C cutters are interesting, but it is kind of a big expense to have 
        one sitting around and seldom used. This rig Hoss put together leverages 
        things like the 4th axis and laminate cutter that are useful for a lot 
        of other purposes. Looks to me like the hardest thing about it would be 
        the g-code. We need someone to write a Mach 3 wizard to generate it for 
        any size endmill and then we'd really be in business!</font></p>

        Up to Wire the Box</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been getting in a plethora 
        of odds and ends to start wiring up the enclosure. I've now got everything 
        except a relay I will use for the E-stop circuit and the master AC on/off 
        switch for the front panel. I also did a number of versions of the overall 
        schematic. The latest is on the <a href="CCMillCNCElectronics.html">enclosure 
        page</a>. Based on my latest schematics, I've done a layout for how I'll 
        go about mounting the various sub-boards in the enclosure:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Enclosure/EnclosureBoards.jpg" width="1024" height="719"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My goal this weekend 
        would be to get the enclosure to the point I can actually mount the boards 
        and begin the wiring process next weekend, and hopefully try spinning 
        some servos (though not on the machine) next weekend as well. There's 
        quite a bit of work to do there, but if I get enough hours I should reach 
        that stage. Fingers crossed!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still need to 
        make an arm to support the keyboard and monitor, I need to mount the enclosure 
        to the rolling cabinet, and I also need to paint it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's still 
        a lot of fussing. I haven't spec'd or ordered any of the auxilliary panel 
        connectors, for example. I have some sitting around the parts bin that 
        will hopefully work. Have to look at them as well. If need be, I can delay 
        VFD and coolant wiring until after the servos are running and it would 
        be no big deal.</font></p>
