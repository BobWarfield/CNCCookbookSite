      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed a few customer-reported Find/Replace problems.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Changing the Soft Limit alarms on the Info Tab will force a replot to pick up the new alarms.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed several issues with 4th axis support.  Still a lot more to do here, but it is working on simple cases.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed issues with G95 feed per revolution mode.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed an error in the Info Tab statistics which caused it to double count the number of arcs.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">- Tested improved usability functions down to 1024 x 600 (some netbooks use that resolution). To work at these resolutions requires reducing font sizes and the elimination of some of the Tool Bar buttons. All the eliminated buttons are still accessible via the menus.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  There is an option under the Tools Options menu to allow you to change the Font Size for g-code.  This will help you to adjust readability.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a problem where sometimes the GWE window would open up bigger than the screen, making it hard to get it back under control.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">- Lots of people were reporting that GWE was hanging when they saved Setup. It was very slow, but it wasn't hanging. Unfortunately, it was hiding the message that would've made what was happening a lot clearer. That message now shows up properly.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Did a bunch of tuning on the simulator playback speed because it was still going way too fast at the slowest settings. It now runs pretty slowly at the lowest settings and will smoothly accelerate to the fastest settings.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">- Implemented a history list for Revisions. Now the Tools menu will list your most recently used Revisions at the bottom. What this means is fewer keystrokes or mouse clicks are needed for your most commonly used Revisions, such as renumbering.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Revisions now save their settings each time they're used and come up with the same settings they had last time.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- The &quot;Jmp&quot; buttons now automatically switch the Simulator to Single Block mode if you use one.  Before, if Single Block was not on, the Simulator was just run the whole program.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Changed all use of &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Yes&quot; in popups to be a specific verb reflecting what the popup will do.  This is part of the Apple UI guidelines and makes software easier to use.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">- Add M31 and M33 chip auger commands to the Haas canned posts.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added a progress popup when saving Setup options. People were thinking it had frozen.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug where you could reach a point on mouse wheel zooming where it just locks up and won't get either larger or smaller.  Now you can back out by going to lower magnifications.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed problems associated with loading a new file in the middle of a simulator session.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug where line gutter wouldn't always show errors right after a file was loaded.</p>

      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">10<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">/6/12: Release 0.680</font> (Signalled for Feathered Upgrade)</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.680</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is a major feature release:</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added support for Fanuc SETVN, which allows you to name variables and refer to them by name instead of using numbers.   &quot;#1&quot; could be named &quot;#HOLEDIA&quot;, for example.  There is a new post variable,   &quot;Macro.SetSN&quot;, which should be set to &quot;true&quot; if your controller supports SETVN.   Many do not, including many Fanuc controls. It is on by default for the Fanuc canned profiles though.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added a special &quot;Soft&quot; SETVN feature.  This allows you to place SETVN statements in comments that begin with &quot;*GWE*&quot;.  For example, suppose we have the following program:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">%<br>
        ( SETVN Test )<br>
        ( *GWE* SETVN 500 [PROBEDIA, HOLEDIA, XPOS, YPOS] )<br>
        #500 = 0.010<br>
        #501 = 3.000<br>
        #502 = 0.0<br>
        #503 = 1.0<br>
        #600 = #500<br>
        #601 = #501<br>
        #602 = #502<br>
        #603 = #503<br>
        M30<br>
        %</p>
      <p class="BodyText">It's legal for most controls that support #variables at all, because the SETVN is in a comment.   Now go to the Tools Revise menu and choose the &quot;GWE Directives&quot; choice.   Make sure the &quot;SETVN Do&quot; radio button is selected and press &quot;Apply&quot;.  The program is now transformed as though your controller supports SETVN:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">%<br>
        ( SETVN Test )<br>
        ( *GWE* SETVN 500 [PROBEDIA, HOLEDIA, XPOS, YPOS] )<br>
        #PROBEDIA = 0.010<br>
        #HOLEDIA = 3.000<br>
        #XPOS = 0.0<br>
        #YPOS = 1.0<br>
        #600 = #PROBEDIA<br>
        #601 = #HOLEDIA<br>
        #602 = #XPOS<br>
        #603 = #YPOS<br>
        M30<br>
        %</p>
      <p class="BodyText">You can work on it and debug the macros with variable names that are actually understandable.  When you get ready to save, just run the &quot;Undo&quot; form of the same revision and it strips all the SETVN names back out and restores the correct numbers as defined in your *WE* comments.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">We'll use this choice to provide a way to store more information in *GWE* comments in the future, but for now, it just has SETVN.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">I've marked this feature &quot;Experimental&quot;, as it is pretty radical.   I'll be looking forward to hearing your feedback on it, but for me, it makes macro programming a lot easier.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  In an effort to make things easier for newcomers, or anyone who needs help, there are two new buttons on the Login Bar:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Getting Started: This button takes you to our Getting Started page on the web site (<a href="http://www.cnccookbook.com/GWEOverview.html">http://www.cnccookbook.com/GWEOverview.html</a>).  This page has a list of resources available to help, a video tour of the product, and a written tour as well.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  Support: This button takes you to our Customer Portal where you can search our Knowledge Base, file support tickets to get help, make suggestions for new features, and vote on all the open suggestions so the ones you like move closer to the top of the priorities.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">As we go forward, I'll be making more videos and revising the online documentation to be more complete and up to date. GW Editor is finally reaching a point where the UI is stable enough to be worth documenting better as we get closer to shipment.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- The last feature-related activity was to put a bunch of fine tuning in to accomodate lower screen resolutions.   The resolution limits are largely a function of the width of the toolbars, so they automatically tune themselves to be narrower as resolution drops.   It's still not happy at 1024 x 768, but it is much better down to 1200 x 800 or so.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Further tuning on mouse smoothness while running the debugger/simulator.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed the bug that could cause the Backplot to do a wild corkscrewing run during debugger playback. It is much more stable now.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added the &quot;Replace Addresses&quot; revision that makes it easy to replace one address with another.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- I'll be turning on the &quot;Bat Signal&quot; for this one so people will be signalled to upgrade in groups over the course of a week.</p>

      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">9<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">/28/12: Release 0.655</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.655</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is a minor feature release.</span> <span class="BodyText">&nbsp;Lots of neat stuff in this release, but my favorite is &ldquo;instant registration&rdquo;. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not quite instant, but it beats the heck out of the hours long delays our current registration system has. &nbsp;I was able to get registered as fast as I could type and confirm the email link. &nbsp;We need to thoroughly test it, so we started it out on GW Editor. &nbsp;Assuming all goes well, we&rsquo;ll add it for GW Calculator when we do our next release there.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">Last release we switched on the new 3D graphics library, which made the backplot dramatically faster. &nbsp;This release includes a number of fixes and tweaks to that new code as well as other areas:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- &nbsp;I broke out Errors onto its own tab rather than making it part of Hints. &nbsp;That makes it simpler, easier, and more obvious to get to.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- &nbsp;Down Arrow advances the debugger as does the space bar, so you don&rsquo;t have to keep clicking with the mouse.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- &nbsp;The mouse felt like you were dragging through some 80 weight gear oil whenever the debugger was running, even when it was in Feed Hold and not doing anything. &nbsp;I think I got that tuned up and fixed.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- &nbsp;Fixed a slew of problems with the run-time estimation over on the Info Tab. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s much better now!</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- &nbsp;Fixed a weird bug that made it comingle values across multiple Post files.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- &nbsp;Fixed a unit conversion problem with Hints. &nbsp;They were not respecting the current unit setting from the Setup tab.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">It&rsquo;s a nice collection of goodies. &nbsp;More to come, but I wanted to get the faster registration out in people&rsquo;s hands so we can shake it out and deploy for GW Calc too.</p>

      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">9<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">/21/12: Release 0.650</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.650</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is a major release, so I really cranked up the version number from the last release (0.570). </span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">The biggest highlight is the release is now taking advantage of your graphics card, whereas before it was doing all the heavy lifting for the backplotter with the cpu. That means this release is dramatically faster, especially on larger 3D files.  You must be runnin g Flash Player 11 or later, and the newer the Flash Player you have, the more graphics cards are supported.   Some very old cards may not be supported.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">This is a major change to the code base, so be on the look out for new bugs and irregularities.  Please let me know if you find anything via <a href="mailto:bob@cnccookbook.com">email</a>.   Just in case, I have moved the last release over to the <a href="http://www.cnccookbook.com/GWizard/GWEInstallPrior.html">Prior Release Install Page</a>.  If things get too crazy, just fall back to the prior release, but make sure to send me an email so I know what to fix.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">There are a number of other useful changes as well:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Lots of work was done to fix bugs and make the scrolling behavior smoother for hints and the g-code tabs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug in G12/G13 (circular pocketing) where it was requiring Z to be set on each use.  Z should be modal.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug where Browsing newly downloaded controllers was showing the wrong directory. </p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed some bugs around Imperial vs Metric in the G-Wizard Calculator integration and the GWCC Conversational CNC wizards.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed some nasty bugs that would hang the program if you pressed &lt;Escape&gt; and other control keys.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- A variety of other fit and finish issues were addressed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">9<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">/13/12: Release 0.570</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.570</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is a feature release:</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  The Post tab under Settings has a new tab called &quot;Mapper&quot;.  Basically, &quot;Mapper&quot; does a search and replace at the last minute before the code is executed.   This makes it easy to remap g-codes since different controls have them under different numbers as well as many other things, such as Fanuc A/B/C style lathe g-codes (coming soon!).  Here is the Mapper in action changing G90/92/94 to G290/292/294:</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizardE/Posts/GCodeMapper.jpg" width="800" height="510" alt="G-Code Mapper"></p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added G290, G292, and G294 lathe cycles. Normally, these would be G90/92/94, but these codes need to be mapped since their normal slots are used for other things on mills, for example.  So, the canned profiles use the Mapper to remap them appropriately so that programs can just refer to G90/92/94.   G90 is an OD/ID turning cycle, G92 is a threading cycle, and G94 is a facing cycle.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Macro variable #3402 tells the current active plane:  G17 = 0, G18 = 1, G19 = 2. </p>
      <p class="BodyText">Fixed a number of bugs including:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  M-code hints weren't showing</p>
      <p class="BodyText">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="BodyText">-  Added canned profiles for Centroid controls.  They're very similar to Fanuc with the addition of the M25 command and Centroid's ':' for rest of line comments.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  The Centroid M25 command is programmed with a new facility that allows g- and m-codes to be mapped to macros.   We simulate Centroid M25 using G28 in this way.     The macro files appear in your Posts subdirectory off the GWE preferences directory. You can find that directory using the Settings Files page.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Tweaked BridgeportDX32 post.    This post is a stopgap at best as we're still missing a lot of features needed to do full DX32 simulation.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Made the simulator a lot faster to start and run continuously.  Fixed a number of problems related to running very large programs through the simulator.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Took out the popups when simulating code containing operator stops. The debugger will simply stop and can be restarted again.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed lots of problems relating to the definition custom g- and m-codes and a number of other user-reported bugs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There are important changes under the covers for several future releases.</p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.515</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is largely a bug fix  release. </span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">There is one minor feature enhancement in that the &quot;Monitor&quot; Revision can now add code both before and after the words you specify.  The Monitor Revision searches through code for particular word/address combinations and then adds the string you specify either before or after the word/address pair. </p>
      <p class="BodyText">We also mocked up the GWCC (GW Conversational CNC) Turning Wizard for lathes, although it is not yet capable of generating any code.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Bug fixes were in the following areas:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed several reported issues in the GWCC Hole Wizard.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed several bugs in the canned drilling cycles.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added some additional hints, for example they now tell the hole bottom coordinate for canned drilling cycles.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  The hint line below the backplot used to be too small and wouldn't stay resized if you changed it.  Fixed.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a number of problems associated with defining and saving custom g- and m-codes.  The typical use for this function is to ignore some code that GWE doesn't support and that doesn't really affect the backplot.</p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.511</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is a minor feature release.

      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">8<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">/1/12: Release 0.500</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rele<span class="BodyText">ase 0.500</span></font><span class="BodyText"> is a major update.  It involves a complete rewrite of the Post functionality that's used to configure the Editor/Simulator to the particular g-code dialect each control uses.    There is overall documentation for it on the <a href="GWESetup.html">GWE Setup page</a>, but most of it should be self-documenting due to the way the new UI works.    You can find it under Setup on the Posts tab.   There are sub-tabs there and the biggest change is for the &quot;Settings&quot; tab.    It provides a scrolling list of all the options needed to customize the behavior.   For each entry you get the ability to see the current value, edit the value, as well as a brief description of what it does.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">In addition to the new UI, we've changed how you go about downloading pre-defined posts.    They're accessed from the Machine Profile page:</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/GWizardE/Docs/GWSetup.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="462"></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Start by clicking &quot;Download Latest Controllers&quot;.   This causes GWE to bring down all the latest controllers from your Internet connection to our &quot;Cloud&quot;.   Once that's done, you can click &quot;Browse&quot; to select the particular controller you'd like to use.       We now have a number of new profiles that cover Fanuc and Mach3, Mill and Lathe, for both Inch and Metric.   More control profiles will follow.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Lastly, the syntax of these files has been changed to make them simpler to edit and understand.  Look for &quot;.pst&quot; files in your Preferences directory.  You can find that directory under the Files tab.    Just edit the &quot;.pst&quot; file with any text editor.       They're much simpler to understand than the old xml file format.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">These changes should make it easier for users to customize their post as well as for CNCCookbook to produce canned profiles and keep them up to date.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Given how much of a rewrite has gone on with this release, I'm going to wait a week for it to shake out any new problems before I turn on the update signal.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">Most of the work on 0.430 is not visible and involves preparation to take advantage of native GPU support starting with Flash Player 11.   There has also been some minor bug fix work done such as fixing some problems reported with saving some of the Post options.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Given how extensive the behind the scenes restructuring has been, be on the look out for any graphics problems and please report them if you see any. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">2/5/12: Release 0.426</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.42</span></font><span class="BodyText">6 is a minor feature release:</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added Haas-style G68/69 coordinate rotation to the Post options.  Haas uses A and B for the two coordinates identifying the rotation center and R for the angle.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added a message to confirm before deleting a custom cycle.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed an error when using negative &quot;R&quot; on arcs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added M13/M14 to start the spindle and coolant.  This m-code is common on many CNC lathes.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added options to the Settings Errors page that control the spindle, feedrate, and toolchange checks.   These checks are made to ensure the spindle is spinning, feedrate is set, and a tool is selected when feed motion is entered (G01 or arcs).   Also, there is an option on the toolchange check to just check for T and ignore M06 since many lathes don't use M06.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">1/30/12: Release 0.425</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.425 is a bug fix release.  It fixes bugs in these areas:</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="BodyText">-  Some that were hanging the simulator.</span></font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Problems with simulator apparently not running.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Problems with synchronizing the line gutter scrolling with program text scrolling on very short programs.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">1/8/12: Release 0.422</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.422 is a bug fix release:</span></font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed some major memory leaks.   This should make GWE  more stable, able to handle larger files, able to run longer, and perhaps faster.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug when running in metric with G21 where Feedrate was left Imperial.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed several bugs to do with scrolling in the Hints view.</p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-  Added G68/69 coordina<span class="BodyText">te rotation processing.</span></font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Extended Internet connection timeout for a session to reduce likelihood of a false &quot;No Connection&quot; status.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed bugs around Post formats for &quot;F&quot; word. Added ability to specify Post format for &quot;R&quot; word.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Changed default starting position for machine from X0Y0Z1 to Z0Y0Z0.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug where if saving and you typed a name with no extension, 2 dots were added: &quot;filename..ncc&quot;.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug in how variables were being mapped to words for a G65 call.  Thanks Andrew for pointing that one out!</p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-  Fixed a bug that caused changes to the Post to be lost under some circumstances.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- When you get the popup telling you that you are not a registered user, the button will now take you to the GWE registration instead of the GWC registration.</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">11/13/11: Release 0.410</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.410 is a feature release:</span></font></p>
<p class="BodyText">Note: This release requires Flash Player 11, which is the latest player. While we don't really use its features yet, we're trying to get everyone on the same page with us before we introduce features that will only work on FP 11.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Lots of work to bring all the work offset options to life so you can now use the extended ones (Fanuc with 48 or 300 offets, for example) and the correct system variables will be saved between sessions to capture these.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added &quot;Custom&quot; Cycles. These are little code snippets accessed via the &quot;Custom&quot; button for your program.  By default you get a Safe Start, End Program, and Park Mill cycle. They're customizable and you can add as many of your own as you like. This is a good way to create and build up your macro libraries, for example.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added some checking to Machine Profile in setup so you can't do things like set max feedrate to 0.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/15/11: Release 0.400</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.400 is a major feature release:</span></font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added markers to the backplot.  There are now markers at the g-code start, g-code end, and for the g-code line the cursor is currently on:</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizardE/Posts/GWEMarkers.jpg" width="800" height="612" alt="Backplot markers"></p>
      <p class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-  </font>Subprogram tab now shows the comment on the line of the &quot;O&quot; word for the subprogram.  Makes it easier to spot what the subprogram does if you comment it.  You can also double click on the subprogram tab to navigate to that spot on the program.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added &quot;Time in Cut&quot; and &quot;Distance in Cut&quot; data to the Tool Table.  This is useful for calculating tool wear information so you can keep up with when you might want to replace the cutter or how long they last for particular jobs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There are new visibility and color controls on the tool table. You can individually control visibility of each tool in the backplot by turning the little light bulb on or off--just click it.  You can also change the feed speed color of each tool independently.  Just click the color box to popup a color chooser. The rapids color remains the same for all tools.  Colors and visibility status will be remembered by tool number across sessions and for all programs.   You can reset the colors under the Backplot Options menu choice.</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizardE/Posts/GWEPlotColorViz.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="Individual tool visibility and color options for the backplot"></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Radically improved the variable editing screen for work offsets.     Go to Setup Post Variables and select the work offset buttons to see it.  If you set up a work offset, it is saved across sessions and applies to all programs.</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizardE/Posts/GWEWorkOffsets.jpg" width="800" height="426" alt="Setting up work offsets"></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added Post option for Okuma-style work offsets.  Okuma uses G15 Hx, where x is a number from 0..50.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Re-arranged some of the Toolbar buttons to prepare for the future and make it more space efficient.  The &quot;Custom&quot; button is not hooked up yet.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  There is now a post option for the tolerance on how much the radius of an arc can differ when measured from each endpoint.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bunch of bugs in areas like relative coordinates, work offsets, the revisions, bunch of backplot bugs, and several other areas.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">9/2/11: Release 0.330</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.330 </span></font><span class="BodyText">is a fit and finish release:</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There is a new Delete Words revision that can be used to delete words. Use it to delete all occurences of a particular word (such as an axis), or just those that have a particular address (such as a particular g-code).</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  There is a new &quot;Monitor&quot; revision.  It's purpose is to search for a particular word and then add code right after the word.  For example, you can use it to add a &quot;DPRNT&quot; to monitor tool life.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Major overhaul of the UI for the &quot;5Step&quot; button on the simulator. You now get buttons for all the step modes right under the regular simulator control cluster. This makes it easier to access them and switch back and forth between the modes.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  GWE now has an &quot;Auto&quot; mode for Incremental versus Absolute Arc IJK.   This is the most common thing you'd have to fix to see a backplot of code from a new machine.  You can also force it to select either incremental or absolute IJK.  Hoping to get beginners up and running sooner with a decent backplot this way.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed a collection of clipboard bugs that were leaving garbage characters and sometimes truncating text in the clipboard.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Took a run at the window sizing bug that affects a few people.  The symptom is it comes up and there is white space along the right and/or bottom edges between the UI and the edge of the window.  If you've been seeing this, and it goes away, please let me know.  If you've been seeing it and it hasn't gone away, let me know that two.  There are two attempted fixes.  One is triggered automatically.  If that isn't working for you, try using the backplot refresh icon on the toolbar, which will trigger the second fix.  Again, let me know your status on this problem.  I can't reproduce it on my own machine, so it's going to take some trial and error to track it down and fix it.  I appreciate the help!</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Updates to the Monotonicity checking for G71. Partial progress on Type 2 for G71.  Feel free to play with it, but expect problems.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- The default format for the Adjust Addresses revision was changed from &quot;O&quot; to &quot;X&quot;.</p>
<p class="BodyText">-  Hints were not always refreshed properly, so added code to force a refresh when the background backplot processing finishes.</p>
<p class="BodyText">-  Macro variables (#variables) were only getting cleared at startup.  They're now cleared whenever the simulator or backplot starts over from the beginning.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Fixed a whole flock of little bugs to do with #vars and parameterized programming.  A lot of programs that wouldn't work right now do.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Fixed some bugs on the Tools tab. Also set it up so the Tool List is the default view and the Tool Changes are available by switching the control at the top.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Added a bunch of new statistics to the Info Tab including:  Total time in cut, total distance in cut, time and distance in rapids, average feedrate in cut, total number of tool changes, and time spent changing tools.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">8/17/11: Release 0.320</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Releas<span class="BodyText">e 0.320 is </span></font><span class="BodyText">all about getting G71 working at long last.   It's still only Type 1, but we have both the 1 line and 2 line formats available.  Setup is via Post.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">Other changes include:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Implemented repeat (L) word for M98.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Added a post option that determines whether helical interpolation is allowed by the controller.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- We display the DOS (8.3) short file name on the status bar in a field that you can right click to copy from.   Some controllers only have the DOS short file names so it is handy to be able to see what such a file name would be for a file with a long name.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Made the trident letters face the user so you can see what the axes are.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">8/11/11: Release 0.310</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Release 0.310 is all about getting a customer's program to backplot.   I wanted him to be able to try it so he could give me further feedback, otherwise I would probably have added more before releasing it.  With that said, 0.310 has some useful thi<span class="BodyText">ngs:</span></font></p>
      <p class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-  </font>We now detect and backplot helical interpolation.  </p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  When performing helical interpolation, the Hints will tell you the pitch of the helix (useful for checking whether your thread milling is correct) and the depth of the helix.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- The simulator information below the backplot has been reformatted for clarity by putting some white space between the mode information and the trace of #variables.  </p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  A new subprogram call list (stack trace) has been added to the simulator info below the backplot.  It lists the M97/M98/G65 calls by line number.  If there is a repeat factor on the call, it will be reflected by an &quot;L&quot; after the caller line # plus the number of repeats left to execute:  </p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizardE/Docs/StackTrace.jpg" width="572" height="157" alt="subprogram stack trace"></p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Implemented repeat factors on M97.  I'll get them for M98 in the next release.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a number of bugs relating to M97/M99 and a few other things along the way.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">8/9/11: Release 0.300</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Release 0.300 is another performance enhancement release, and pretty big progress at that.  0.300 is capable of loading and backplotting a large file up to 7x faster than 0.260, hence we've bumped up to the next 0.100.   It's the biggest performance increment we've had yet and several breakthroughs are responsible.  All told the software is probably 10x faster than it was 2 weeks ago about backplotting and processing the Hints and Error Messages.  There's still a lot more performance enhancements to come since we haven't gotten the new Flash Player 11 with hardware graphics card <span class="BodyText">acceleration yet, but even without we're finally getting into the performance neighborhood we should be in, though we're still far from finished with performance.</span></font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">In addition to the big performance boost, there are a couple of other goodies:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There is a new full width cursor when running the simulator to make it easier to see exactly where you are in the g-code.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed some issues with the Line Number gutter getting out of sync with the lines.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Fixed some bugs in Haas-style M97/M99.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Miscellaneous other tweeks.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">8/6/11: Release 0.260</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Release 0.260 is focused on editing commands:</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">- The Adjust Addresses revision can now be used to change the formatting of numbers to match the post.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There is a new Arc Adjust revision that can change IJK center to R format and vice versa, and it can change IJK from relative to absolute and vice versa.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There is a new Feeds and Speeds override that can be used to adjust feeds and speeds either for all tools or for a particular tool number.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Some of the revisions require the backplot to be up to date so they can use it's information. They will pop up a message saying the backplot needs to be up to date if it isn't.  Just close the popups and wait for the backplot to finish updating.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- There is a new revision that can convert coordinates back and forth between relative and absolute.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Did some slight rearranging of the toolbar to make room for some features coming in future releases.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- New &quot;Jump to closest endpoint in backplot&quot; feature.  Click the new icon on the toolbar (magnifier with a &quot;Play&quot; arrow) to turn it on. Now when you click the mouse on the backplot, it moves the g-code cursor to the next line that refers to the nearest endpoint to where you clicked.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- A preferred file extension for use when saving files without extensions may be selected under the Tools Options menu.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Two buttons on the Adjust Address revision allow switching to and from lathe diameter or radius mode.</p>
      <p class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-  A few more performance enhancements: backplot is another 20% faster.</font> </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">8/3/11: Release 0.251</font> &amp; 0.252</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">When lots changes (0.250), we get Bug Fix Releases:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed an annoying bug that caused carriage returns to be dropped when typing in under some conditions.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Turned on release feathering. Before, every GWE release was mandatory.  Now, by default, some are mandatory, and some are notified over the course of 7 days.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug where the revisions and some other commands would mysteriously delete a line.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">8/2/11: Release 0.250</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Release 0.250 is primarily focused on performance and usability.  Quite a lot of tuning was done to speed up basic editing (making typing feel less &quot;slushy&quot;) as well as to speed up the parsing and backplotting.   Some new things you'll notice:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  There is a new set of Refresh options on the Backplot Options menu.   These control how often a background update to hints (error messages) and the backplot is done. &quot;Auto-Refresh&quot; is the old default.   What's new is a file size entry that will turn off &quot;Auto-Refresh&quot; on files larger than the specified size. The default threshold is 256 K bytes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  When Auto-Refresh is off, refreshing the backplot and hints is deferred until the g-code type-in pane loses focus (due to a popup or switching to another view), or until the user has stopped doing anything in that pane for a time (1.5 seconds is the current setting).</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Once a non-auto refresh starts, it tends to go much faster (up to 2x as fast), but the system will be less responsive until it finishes that auto-refresh.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  When you load a file, a popup will appear for larger files that says &quot;Hang on, processing a big file.&quot; While that popup is visible, the system is totally focused on getting through the refresh as fast as possible (again, up to 2x faster than prior releases).  If you press &quot;Cancel&quot;, it will pause where it is and wait for the next opportunity to refresh (i.e. during another popup or if you initiate the refresh).</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- You can tell if you are in manual- or auto-refresh via a message on the status bar at the bottom.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- If in manual, and you want the system to refresh, either press F9 (same as &quot;recalc&quot; in Excel), click the replot icon on the Tool Bar, or select &quot;Backplot Refresh&quot; from the menus.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Did some fit and finish work on the Hints to make them more readable.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug that was causing m-codes to never show any hints.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- There is a new option to Edit in CAPS except in comments.  By default it is turned on, but may be turned off under Tools Options.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Lots more performance updates yet to come, but this release should help.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">7/25/11: Release 0.200</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">This has been a massive release nearly a month in the making, so I'm going to bump up a full 0.1 number to 0.200. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Here's what we did in 0.200:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added an Axis Switch revision to make it easy to switch axes when <a href="http://cnccookbook.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/swapping-axes-for-right-angle-heads-horizontal-mills-and-such/">programming right angle heads and such</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Added an Adjust Words revision to make it easy to do simple math on the addresses associated with words.   You can see how to use it in our <a href="CCCNCGCodeDigitsMacros.htm">g-code tutorial on making an engraving font</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Renumber blocks will now proactively adjust references to numbers that change from GOTO, G71, and other sources.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- The remainder of Fanuc Macro B was added, largely consisting of GOTO, IF, and WHILE.  See also our <a href="CCCNCGCodeCourse.htm">mini-tutorial on g-code macros</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- You now have the ability under Post Numbers to choose a default word format that is used for words that have no defined format.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  M99 was really getting confused about where to return to if there were no N numbers and sometimes even when there were.  Fixed that bug.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Top View and the other non-perspective views were acting strange.  I fixed several bugs that should help a lot there.  There was also some funny business when zooming these views with the scroll wheel that has been fixed.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  There's now a warning for particularly large files that they're likely to be slow.  Performance is a priority, but we have a lot of work left to do there yet.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  After learning that large multinational companies dropped 2.9 million jobs from the US and hired 2.4 million overseas during the 2000's, I added a made in America to our logo.   Help out the small companies, they're the ones creating jobs here.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug where GWE would erroneously decide various G and M-codes were unavailable and flag them as errors.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Lots more sniggly little details of fit, finish, and stability.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">6/30/11: Release 0.138</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">The big news for 0.139 are some macro debugging capabilities partially inspired by the need to help a GWE user.    For full details, <a href="http://cnccookbook.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/adding-infinite-loop-detection-and-macro-stepping-to-g-wizard-cnc-editor/">read the article about debugging infinite loops</a> which details the various new features.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Still a lot of work going on under the covers with G71 and the other lathe cycles.  I decided to rewrite them from scratch given what I had learned the first go-round.   They'll be a lot more robust and it'll be easier for me to cover all the different crazy options different controls bring.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">6/9/11: Release 0.138</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.138 continues the work on the G71 rough turning cycle, which now handles arcs.  It's still not finished, but is considerably more useful.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">In addition, we've improved the Revisions user interface quite a bit:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- There is now a &quot;Revision:&quot; button on the tool bar that triggers the last revision you ran during the session.  If none have been run, it just brings up the menu listing the various revisions.  You can see the name of the revision that would be called to the right of the &quot;Revision&quot; button, and if you press the down arrow it will bring up the revision list.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-   The revision list now allows selection of whether to run the revision against the entire program (default) or the currently selected blocks.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-   The initial version of the line renumbering Revision has been added.   There are a couple of options not implemented in the UI that are grayed out.  In addition, this version doesn't adjust references in macros or canned cycles, but a later one will.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">5/31/11: Release 0.137</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Some good stuff in 0.137:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Coolest new feature is the 5-Step button for the Simulator got a whole lot more powerful.   By default, clicking it advances the simulator 5 blocks when in Single Block mode.   However, you can either right click it or use the Simulator Options menu choice to bring up more modes for this button:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o You can set it to almost any number of blocks to be executed instead of just 5.</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o  You can set it to run to the next tool change (M06).</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o  You can set it to run to the next rapids (G00).</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o You can set it to run to the next dwell (G04).  Since G04 doesn't affect the behavior most times, use it as a convenient marker you can drop into your code to make it easier to run to that point.</p>
      </blockquote>
<p align="left" class="BodyText">- There is a new Simulator menu.  Most of the functions were available in the Simulator Toolbar buttons, but they're also on menu now too.  The Simulator menu is documented on the <a href="GWECommands.html">menu commands docs page</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Menus display all their keyboard shortcuts and the shortcuts are implemented.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Added information about the angle subtended by arcs to the Hints. It now tells the start angle, end angle, and total angle.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Thanks to a program submitted by a user (thanks Terry!), a number of subtle problems with arcs in lathe programs were fixed.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Fixed a number of things relating to lathe diameter mode.  For example, the X coordinate of the status bar mouse position display is now consistent with diameter mode.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Backplot Options now allows G28-style moves to be turned off from the backplot and this is the default.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Another round of fixing and tuning for Zoom Extents. It focuses on zooming to fit all the feedrate moves without necessarily fitting all rapids. Got rid of a few more cases that drove it crazy. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">5/24/11: Release 0.135</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">The big news for 0.135 is keyboard shortcuts plus a new &quot;Simulator&quot; pull down menu. The shortcuts are documented on the menus and on the <a href="GWEKeyboard.html">Keyboard page</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Zoom In/Zoom Out shortcuts (Ctrl++ and Ctrl+-) are not yet working but the rest should be good to go.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">I also made a run at fixing a bug where GWE would come up as just a black window and hang. Those of you that encountered that problem, let me know if you are continuing to see it.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">5/20/11: Release 0.134</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.134 is a medium duty release--more than minor and less than major. The bulk of the work continues behind the scenes on Lathe Canned Cycles.  While I have not disabled the G71 work in progress, it is buggy enough that it isn't useful at the moment so no need to report G71 problems.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Here's what's in the release:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Minor performance enhancements, probably not measurable without a stopwatch, but some work was done.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added Fanuc style UVW.  These provide relative addressing for XYZ so you can easily mix the two without going in and out of incremental versus absolute modes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- G32 lathe threading cycle</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- We now have separate g-code lists for lathe and mill.  This area still needs some refinement but is essentially working.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- The Setup window is now resizable.  Some users with lower resolution screens will find this helpful.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Many bug fixes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">4/5/11: Release 0.133</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.133 has some good usability upgrades:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Backplot is about 2x faster than prior releases. Lots more to come.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Rewrote zoom extents yet again.   Seems like it is doing a lot better job zooming to fit the backplot to the window.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Add a Backplot Option to show the bounding box for feed moves as a blue outline.  This box is not a bad proxy for your workpiece.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Large programs use the bounding box to rotate or pan the backplot so it doesn't bog down.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- There is a new Post option to allow &quot;:&quot; instead of (or in addition to) &quot;O&quot;.  Fanuc and some other controls allow this.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Following a customer suggestion, there is now  email contact info on the About box.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- There is a new &quot;simple post&quot; option that simply checks whether numbers are valid numbers or not without all the checking for number of decimal places and so on. This option is on by default to make it easier to get to a backplot when you first start using GWE.   Later on, you can turn it off and customize the exact error checking on numbers just like always.   The parsing stage runs faster with this simple number parser enabled.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- While zooming in with the mouse wheel continues to zoom towards wherever the mouse is pointing, zooming out doesn't zoom out &quot;towards&quot; anything.  This is much more intuitive.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug where screen was getting blurred at startup.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a number of scrolling-related bugs.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">3/28/11: Release 0.132</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.132 is another substantial release:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText"> - New Options choice on the Backplot menu lets you change a few things on the backplot:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o Show or Hide Grid and Simulated Toolholder.</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o Show or Hide Trident.  Place Trident in lower left corner or at Work Coordinate 0, 0, 0</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o Show Endpoints: This option places a marker on the backplot at the beginning and end of each g-code move. Makes it easier to see how the moves are stacked up in various places.</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o Show or Hide Rapids and Feedrate Moves</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o Set Feedrate line thickness. This can be useful for making things more legible or even to create a thickness equal to your cutter diameter so you can see better what is happening. Warning: The scaling is not quite right yet if you want a precise dimension on the line thickness!</p>
      </blockquote>
<p align="left" class="BodyText">- I spent a couple of days improving backplot performance.  Every so often I will do this, moreso towards the end of the Beta.  It has a long ways to go, but it is better than it was.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  The status line and Info tab now tell not only how many lines are in a program but how many bytes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Insert menu now has Insert File (inserts at the cursor) and Append File (adds the file to the end of the current file) commands.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  There is a new Tools Options popup that provides Editor Options:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText">o G-Code file extensions for File Open</p>
        <p align="left" class="BodyText"> o  Default File Save extension when no extension is given.</p>
      </blockquote>
<p align="left" class="BodyText">- Quite a few bug fixes including one where if you had really long names and folder paths you could make the File menu inoperable.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">3/21/11: Release 0.131</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.131 is a big release:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Revisions are back to working again after a long time.  They're under Tool menu. Currently we have Revisors for CAPitalization, Spaces, Control Characters, Comments, and Block Skip.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- I've started a Commands documentation page here:  <a href="http://www.cnccookbook.com/GWECommands.html">http://www.cnccookbook.com/GWECommands.html</a></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Lots more to fill in there.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  You can now edit the parameters comment on g-codes.  You can also delete codes that you've added, but not the stock codes. Set the stock codes to ignore or make them unavailable.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  M99 in the main program (not a subprogram) with no args returns to top of main program. You can give it args to make it return to a specific block (N) # in the main program.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- M98 now has an L-word repeat factor (Mach3)</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- M98 can also do the Fanuc style repeat factor.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- M47 is same as M99 in the main program but cannot be executed in subprograms.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug where M30 and other codes that were supposed to rewind weren't rewinding.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added G65 macros with arguments passed in via local variables. Calls can be nested up to 5 levels deep. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added some new arc-related post functions.  modal-R lets you make the radius modal.  You can also set IJK vs R precedence to decide what happens if both are present. These were added to support Centurion controls on machines like Milltronics.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Further tuning on Zoom Extents. It's even closer, but still is off sometimes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Phew!  Lots going on in this release. Check it out carefully as I'm sure there are some new bugs.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">3/15/11: Release 0.130</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.130 focuses on usability:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Got rid of the popup &quot;No Internet&quot; box. Instead, the notice appears on the login bar at the right.  If G-Wizard absolutely needs to connect due to the 2 week limit, it will do a popup.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Currently installed version number is displayed on the Login Bar.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Several bugs to do with arcs are fixed based on customer feedback--thanks James and Brian!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- The Posts now include a comment, visible at the top of Setup Post, so you can write in a little more detail what's in them.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Lots of tweaks with Zooming and Zoom Extents. For example, Zoom now attempts to zoom towards wherever the mouse tip is pointing.    Also, I finally fixed the bug where if the mouse tip was on a backplot line or grid line, all zooming and panning was ignored.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">3/10/11: Release 0.129</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Minor release. A couple of bug fixes plus the ability to manage your CNC Controller Profiles (aka &quot;Posts&quot;) better. The Controller Browse button not only allows you to download profiles, but also to pick from profiles you have on your local hard disk.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">3/7/11: Release 0.128</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">This is a very big release:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Complete overhaul of Find/Replace and the Jump editing commands.  These can be accessed either via the Edit menu or the toolbar buttons.  They each use a very slick toolbar presentation instead of popping up dialog boxes that get in the way.  Try them out.  I particularly like the Jump menu which will skip from tool change to tool change or error to error forwards and backwards.  The major remaining editing functionality is in Revisions and Auto-Revisions.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- #parameters and [expressions] are essentially 95% done. There are some niggling details that will be worked out before shipping, but they're no longer a high-priority emphasis. Therefore, I have taken this entry off of the &quot;What doesn't work&quot; list above.   Some of the new features in this area include ATAN, OR, XOR, AND, MOD, and the &quot;**&quot; power operator for Mach3.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Tried to speed the opening of the setup tab.  It's a lot faster, but switching to the Post sub-tab is now slow. DOH!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed lots of little fit and finish issues that come up as you try to use GWE to &quot;etch-a-sketch&quot; g-code by creating a program from start to finish.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Several bugs associated with error reporting on arcs.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">3/3/11: Release 0.127</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Feature-wise, the big news is Find/Replace is now up and running.   I used a ribbon UI rather than popups because it's easier on real estate and doesn't cover up what you're searching for. Next release will see a similar UI for the Jump command.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- The simulator backplotter now accesses system variables #5161..5164 to determine the machine's starting and tool change positions. This is the same as Fanuc and other controllers. The default for these variables is X0Y0Z1.  You can change them in Setup Post.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- New Tip button in top right next to the help button so you can bring up the tips manually.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- New G-Codes control diameter versus radius mode programming for the X-axis. This is a lathe feature.  G190 = OFF (Radius).  G191 = (ON Diameter).  A number of controllers use these codes, but some you will have to remap to different g-code #'s.  Hurco and Allen Bradley use G07 and G08, Omniturn uses G72/73, etc.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- G96 and G97 (the Constant Surface Speed commands) are now implemented. These are mostly lathe g-codes.    You will see the system accept SFM or M/Min instead of RPM when this option is invoked.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added a &quot;Replot&quot; button to the toolbar that forces a full rebuild and repaint of the backplot.  Comes in handy if things get screwed up, but otherwise, not so much I suspect.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Added the ability to define one or more full line comment characters. Anything after a full line comment is treated as comment. EMC allows &quot;;&quot;, Anilam allows &quot;*&quot;, etc. Currently, &quot;%&quot; is used as an EOL comment too, but that will go away when we start processing %'s true meaning.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a bunch of bugs in the Edit Jump function. It should be working properly now.  Expect a UI overhaul to make it match Find/Replace in the next release.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a host of user reported bugs of various kinds.  For example, TABs were screwing things up in some cases.  Have fixed some but not all the TAB bugs.  Also fixed a bug where File Exit was not exiting.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">2/28/11: Release 0.126</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Bug fixes to the #parameter and [expression] handling plus it covers a few more words.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added an error check for the distance of an arc's center to each endpoint. That distance needs to be the same to within 0.001&quot; or an error message is issued.  It will still plot those arcs, but many controllers alarm out on such cases.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">2/27/11: Release 0.125</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- 0.125 changes the splash screen and About box to suppress the animated G-Wizard logo when you login as a guest.   Some graphics driver combinations don't like the logo and those users were unable to get the product to even load.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  UI for Edit Find/Replace done.  No guts so it doesn't do anything but look pretty though.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">2/24/11: Release 0.124</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">0.124 has the first installment of #parameters and [expressions].  Consider it to be alpha quality in those areas.  We don't yet have all of the expression functions, for example non of the logicals are there (AND, OR, etc.). There are no control structures like IF.    What is working is assignment to variables and the ability to use variables and expressions to derive a value for words.  Not all words covered yet, but the biggies from the sample code I had on hand.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">The simulator state information (below the backplot when the simulator is running) now displays the values of the last 10 or so #variables that were touched.  In addition, the hint as to what the variable is will be displayed in parenthesis.  These hints may be found on Setup Post Variables in the &quot;Description&quot; column.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">I'm looking for folks to try it on their sample code and <a href="mailto:sales@cnccookbook.com">forward problems to me via email</a>. Please attach your sample code.  </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Let me know how this release is doing for you if you practice parameterized programming in g-code.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">2/21/11: Release 0.123</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">This is mostly a bug fix and &quot;keeping current with G-Wizard Calculator&quot; release:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  GWE now has the same &quot;Tips&quot; popups as GWC, with the content customized for the Editor, of course.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added Block Delete handling. There's a new button up by the simulator controls that turns Block Delete on or off.   If it's &quot;ON&quot;, blocks preceeded by &quot;/&quot; are ignored. If it's &quot;ON&quot;, they treated just like normal blocks.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Lots of foundational work done towards #parameters and [expressions], but it's not really visible.  Should be ready to roll out before too much longer.  I'm now starting to test it.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">2/10/11: Release 0.122</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">Big news is the ability to download predefined CNC Controller (e.g. &quot;Post&quot; parameters) from the CNCCookbook servers. Hopefully this will simplify startup for new users.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  There is a new CNC Controller entry on the Setup Basics machine profile.   The browse button next to it allows you to download pre-defined controllers from the CNCCookbook servers (an Internet connection is required).  At this stage we have Mach3 and Fanuc, with Lathe and Mill in inch or metric for both controls. Note that for metric users if you want to read everything in metric you will also need to set the metric units above the machine profile.  To create a custom controller, either start with one of the pre-defined or the one that comes up when you install and make changes. If you don't download a controller, you custom controller will receive the same name as your machine profile.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText2">- Added the ability to control your upgrade notifications. There are three choices:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Immediate: Notify immediately of any new release availability.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Feathered:  You will be notified from 1 to 7 days after a new release is available.  This has been the default.  It gives time for any obvious bugs to be discovered before everyone upgrades.  Disabled for now in GWE because it is <span class="BodyText">changing so rapidly. Therefore Immediate and Feathered both inform as soon as a release is available.  When GWE is further along, I will enable the Feathered option to slow down the pace of updating.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Seve<span class="BodyText">re:  Only mandatory upgrades are flagged.  You'll miss a lot of upgrades this way as I don't mark very many as mandatory.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Move macro variables and G/M-Code setup under the Setup Post tab because everything under that tab is associated with configuring a CNC controller.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  By default, the debugger speed is relatively slow--35%. The idea is to make it a little more obvious what is happening for newcomers.</p>
<p class="BodyText">-  There are now &quot;Tortoise&quot; and &quot;Hare&quot; buttons to immediately go to very fast (100%) or very slow (15%) debugger playback speed. They also serve as labels / reminders for what the % control does.  The playback also remembers whatever execution speed it had the last time GWE was run.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug to issue a warning if there is more than one decimal point in a number.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Got rid of the &quot;Save&quot; button for Startup G-Code. Every other Post parameter is automatically saved.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Reviewed and changed a number of the error messages so they can be selectively disabled at finer granularity. </p>
<p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug that prevented a number of the error messages from being ignored.</p>
<p class="BodyText">- Optional &quot;+&quot; no longer produces an error message if you use a &quot;+&quot; with a number. </p>
<p class="BodyText">-  Did a major overhaul on the preferences save and load code. Be on the lookout for any issues there.</p>
<p class="BodyText">-  Fixed a lot of other bugs!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">1/28/11: Release 0.121</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">0.121 was focused on usability problems and bugs:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText"><span class="BodyText">- Adding popup messages to tell you why your program stopped (e.g. M00, M01, M02, etc.). These only appear when running the simulator, not for simple backplot.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Did a <a href="GWECNCSimulator.html">doc page for the simulator / debugger</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Added the ability to disable any error either permanently, or until a new file is loaded.   This will make it easier to get spurious errors out of the way or checks you just don't want to be making such as whether a tool is loaded when you start making non-rapids moves.  This is accessed via the Hints tab.  Select a line with errors and press the &quot;Errors&quot; button to see the options.  To re-enable an error, go to the Setup Errors tab.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed some finicky bugs in the simulator's run time estimates. They were not updating properly as the machine profile and various other parameters were being changed.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Simulated CAT40 toolholder is no longer shown on Lathes or on Top View where it was hiding the action too much.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Fixed a problem that was causing all the post parameters for numbers to get cleared sometimes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Line gutter now displays &quot;Error:&quot; for lines with an error. This happened by accident. We'll have to see if we like it.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a number of problems to do with scrolling or switching views while the debugger is running.  Not yet ready to declare victory, but it's a lot better.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Spent time trying to make Zoom Extents more accurate.  It too is better, but not best.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">1/17/11: Release 0.120</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">0.120 is a bug fix release for the most part with no new features. It does, however, clean up a lot of problems with the debugger and scrolling behavior.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">1/2/11: Release 0.119</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">- G20/21 Units: Grid is rescaled to fit the units as are the various coordinate indicators.  The default is Imperial, but you can use this g-code in the Post setup g-code to change that.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Toolholder appears miniaturized along with the yellow highlighting to show where in the backplot the currently selected g-code line is.  In Debugger mode, the Toolholder is scaled fullsize to the backplot.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- The line numbers now have a &quot;reverse out&quot; color to make it easier to find the line the cursor is on at all times.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Lathe diameter vs radius modes are now available for Lathe profiles.  Select the option from Setup Post.   When in diameter mode a &quot;dia&quot; will appear by the X's to remind you.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  M98/M99 Subprogams. Style is determined in post.  By default, you will be reminded that you haven't selected a style by an error message.   Repeats are not yet implemented--each call is one shot.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Subprogram tab. There is a new subprogram tab that tells all the &quot;O&quot; subprogram definitions in the current file.  In a future release  it will also identify &quot;N&quot; numbers accessed via M97. You can double click an entry on this view to go to the line where the &quot;O&quot; is defined.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  M97 for Haas-style subroutine calls.   M97 uses the &quot;N&quot; (block) number instead of an &quot;O&quot; number.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Tweaked the editor performance a bit.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Changed the UI of NumPost to autosave so there is no more Save button.  It is saved when you exit Setup.    The tab is also now called &quot;Numbers&quot; under the Setup Post tab.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Quite a bit of tuning to make the auto-zooming more friendly.  For example, it autozooms during debug playback and there is also a minimum zoom so it doesn't blow things up too much when a program starts out with a few small lines or arcs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">- Broke out the options under Setup Post as tabs so you won't have to scroll to see them.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Did quite a lot of tweaking to improve the scroll experience, especially for the hints view.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Fixed bugs involving the saving of number options, error messages on arc radii being too small, and many other areas.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">1/2/11: Release 0.118</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">This release has quite a bit of new functionality:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">G17/G18/G19 are now implemented for arcs and canned cycles.   </p>
      <p class="BodyText">There is now a startup g-code line under Setup Post. You can give it a line of g-code to set the initial state of your controller. For example, most lathes default to &quot;G18&quot;, so you could put a G18 into that line.  See the <a href="GWESetup.html">Setup page</a> to see what the initial state looks like before executing the startup g-code.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">A number of bug fixes and small usability tweaks.  Probably the biggest one is you can change the playback speed when simulating again--it had been stuck at 100%.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">12/23/10: Release 0.117</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">First version with some lathe views.   The view types are automatically switched when you change machine profiles under &quot;Setup&quot;.       They're very likely pretty buggy, but at least we now have Z on the horizontal axis so they look right.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">12/2/10: Release 0.116</font></p>
      <p class="BodyText">Fun addition: 3D rendering of toolholder and tool.       A customer complained it was hard to tell what was going on in the simulation because they couldn't see where the tool was.  So, I got to thinking and added a 3D rendering of the toolholder and tool.  What a difference--so much nicer to work with!   The holder is only shown during simulation (debugger mode).  It is not shown in the Top View, because it hides the action directly underneath.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Because its so much nicer, I made the Perspective View the default leftmost view.     </p>
      <p class="BodyText">Fixed a lot of funny business that happens if you switch Views (Perspective, Top, etc.) in the middle of the simulation. It's still not right, but it's better.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">GWE now scales itself for lower resolution screens.  I tried it and found it usable (though not pretty) down to 800x600.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Added support for 4th axis in 1 position.   LOL, you can set A0, but that's about it so far.  Still, I had to put a bunch of framework in place that will eventually lead to full 4th axis support.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Fixed a bug that was hanging the parser on some files.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Fixed a whole raft of bugs in how canned cycles were being simulated.  Thanks to Mike for working through this one with me!      </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">11/28/10: Release 0.115</font></p>
      <p><span class="BodyText">Added machine label to Setup Variables and Setup G/M-Codes tabs.<BR>
        <BR>
        Fixed a   bug that caused machine profile to be uninitialized when it first comes up on   the Setup tab.<BR>
        <BR>
        G09 Fanuc one shot exact stop<BR>
        <BR>
        G64 P tolerance   parameter<BR>
        <BR>
        G04 w/ no args is an exact stop for Fanuc<BR>
        <BR>
        G10 for   fixture (work) offsets<BR>
        <BR>
        G-Code Support: Check Tool Loaded<BR>
        <BR>
        G-Code   Support: Check Feed Defined<BR>
        <BR>
        G-Code Support: Check Spindle   Off<BR>
        <BR>
        Dwell Address setting options on post.<BR>
        <BR>
        Post options on arcs:   I, j, k relative to current position or absolute for circle center. <BR>
        <BR>
        Parse and process extended work offsets: G54.1 + P, G54 + P<BR>
        <BR>
        Modal   IJK option for absolute IJK posts.<BR>
        <BR>
        Fixed a number of errors in how canned   cycles were being processed.<BR>
        <BR>
        Made the hint area under the backplot format   exactly the same as Hints View. You now can see errors there, for   example.<BR>
        <BR>
        There's quite a lot more behind the scenes in prep for future   releases, but I wanted to get those fixes out as they help several customer's   g-code files.</span><BR>
      </p>
<p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">11/20/10: Release 0.114</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">Did almost a total rewrite on the Setup tab so everything (except for Metric / Imperial) now tracks the currently selected Machine.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Numerous tweaks to the time estimator. For example, there are new settings on the Machine Profile that are used for things like spindle acceleration time.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">G- and M-Codes can now be disabled, ignored, or remapped to other codes. Just double click them on the Setup G-/M-Code tab.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">The File tab under setup now facilitates backing up and restoring settings. Buttons are provided to copy settings en masse to a backup directory of your choosing or back again.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Several new materials were added by customer request, mostly aluminums such as 2219.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">The Tools tab now shows elapsed time information. If you're viewing the tool changes, you see the time when the change occurs. If you're viewing the Tool List, you see the total cutting time for each tool.   This should help when estimating wear by job.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Minor cosmetic: Tools and Info tabs now hide the scroll bar when selected since there is nothing there to scroll and it is sometimes confusing.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">G61, G62, G63, and G64 cutting modes are now implemented.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">11/13/10: Release 0.113</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">The backplotter/simulator now generates time estimates. You can find them in 3 places.  Each hint tells you the elapsed time from beginning of program to get to complete that line.  The Info tab tells the overall elapsed time for the program.   And, if you are running the debugger, the debug info below the backplot will provide the elapsed time to the point you're at in the program. Some details and limitations:
          <blockquote>
            <p>- A block is assumed to take a minimum of 10 milliseconds.  Some controllers may be a little slower or faster, but I've no idea how you could tell.  I may add a tuning parameter later if need be.</p>
            <p>- Motion timing is based on the rapids rate specified in the machine profile and the feedrate.</p>
            <p>- I still need to simulate the time required to change spindle speed.  It is currently instantaneous!          </p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      
        <li class="BodyText">From hints view you can now single or double click a hint. Single clicking moves the cursor in the G-Code tab to that hint's line, but does not switch to the G-Code tab. Double clicking takes you to the G-Code tab with the hint's line selected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">11/6/10: Release 0.112</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">The big news with 0.112 is a whole bunch of the new Tool Data Management functionality is here.  For details, see the <a href="GWETools.html">TDM doc page.</a></li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added G4 Dwell to simulator as well as Post options for Fanuc and Mach3 style syntax.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added G10 for Tool Length Offsets and Tool Diameter Wear Offsets. This is part of the TDM package.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">As always, more bug fixes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">11/2/10: Release 0.110</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">Changed colors on the playback buttons to match what most CNC controls use: Cycle Start is green, Feedhold is yellow, and Stop is red.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">There is an LED indicator that looks like an underline below the Rewind button.     It lights to remind you to press rewind if you want to get into playback mode and start simulating your program.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Fixed some bugs with NumPost around the divisor when there is a decimal vs no decimal point.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added a NumPost category for &quot;T&quot; words so you can specify how many digits are allowed for your tool changes.  The default is 4 digits.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Modified all the Wizards to format any numeric parameters (registers for words) according to the NumPost settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText11">Added 3 new fields to the Tool Crib entries:</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="BodyText2">&nbsp;&nbsp;- Serial #:  Provides a spot to enter an arbitrary serial # associated with the tool. This is useful if your tool management system or process uses serial numbers.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- X Comp:   Compensation measurement for cutter comp on CNC machines. </p>
      <p class="BodyText2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Z Comp: Compensation measurement for tool length on CNC machines.</p>
      <p class="BodyText2">These three fields are all part of some upcoming Tool Data Management features. Basically, they contain the info you'd track if you're using a <a href="CCCNCToolManagement2.html">Tool Presetter</a>. Stay tuned for more on this area as it develops!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/31/10: Release 0.109</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">Added support for reference return to home G-codes: G27/G28/G30.    G30 only supports a second home, and some controllers will handle more.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added a moving highlight on the backplot during toolpath debugging (e.g. when all the info is available below the backplot. It's also visible when you click on a line of g-code. It shows in yellow the part of the toolpath associated with that g-code line.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Fixed a bug in Select All (available from the Edit menu or via Ctrl+A).</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Reduced the transparency on popup windows. Many were complaining they couldn't see the close box as it is black on a black background.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Fixed more bugs having to do with hints building up extra copies of the same text as you run the program over and over.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Modified the NumPost defaults for &quot;S&quot; to go from 4 to 5 decimal places left of the decimal to accomodate 10K rpm spindles.  If you want this default you'll need to reset the S to the defaults, you don't get it automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/23/10: Release 0.108</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">0.108 clears out the remaining bugs testers have reported that are truly bugs, and not features I haven't gotten to implementing yet.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Spent a lot of time trying to make the playback speed as smooth as possible. It feels pretty good to me at this stage.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added a bunch more tool tips for various buttons to help people understand what they do.</li>
      </ul>
<p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/19/10: Release 0.107</font></p>
      <p><span class="BodyText">Some of the NumPost settings were a little too restrictive, especially for Mach3   programs. I tweaked them so fewer errors show. You may want to reset to defaults   from that page to pick up these tweaks as otherwise you won't see them.<BR>
        <BR>
        -   Added G70/71 for inch metric programming. These are identical to G20/21, but   some controllers use G70. There are other controllers that use G70 for a canned   cycle. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.<BR>
        <BR>
        - GWE no longer sees   blank lines as an error. Also, if it finds a character it doesn't expect, it   now gives the ASCII code for the character.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Did a lot of work on the   scroll bar for hints view. You should be able to scroll and see every line in   hints view now.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Hints view now has a combo box that will let you just   see the lines with errors. This provides a fast way to look at all the errors in   a file.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Fixed the Setup G/M-Code tab so you can now turn G-Codes and   M-Codes on, off, or set them to "ignore". If you turn them "off" they're   disallowed with an error. If you turn them "on", GWE tries to run them. If it   doesn't have that code yet, you still get an error. If you set it to "ignore",   it just ignores them and doesn't output an error for them.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Fixed a   bunch of bugs that would mess up the cursor showing where you were executing in   simulator mode. This was very confusing and should be better   now.<BR>
        <BR>
        Overall, this version feels a lot smoother to me when I run the   simulator. I still have a fair number of tester-reported bugs I'm working on.   Next release, hopefully!</span><BR>
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/18/10: Release 0.106</font></p>
      <p><span class="BodyText">Tools Tab:<BR>
        <BR>
        - Changes vs List view. List is the list of tools, and Changes   is every tool change.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Comment capture. If there is a comment above the   tool change, it is captured. Many CAM programs will tell you what the tool is in   that comment, so it's helpful.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Tool List can be mapped to the Tool Crib   (under setup) using either slot or comment. We don't do anything yet with the   matchup, but we will soon.<BR>
        <BR>
        Bug Fixes and Other Changes:<BR>
        <BR>
        -   Sometimes when running the simulator you would get a lot of copies of the hints.   That bug is fixed.<BR>
        <BR>
        Been getting a lot of feedback as we have now tripled   the number of testers. I'll be doing pretty frequent releases, so I have   disabled the release feathering. What that means is everyone sees the "New   Version" notice at once so you know when one is available.</span><BR>
      </p>
<p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/15/10: Release 0.105</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText1">Lots of tweaks and fixes surrounding scrolling. Hopefully this area is now much   more stable.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">A new Tool Change tab that shows you where all the tool   changes occur. Eventually we'll be able to map to tools defined in the Tool Crib   so that there is a lot more information about what's going on in the program.   You'll also be able to double click to navigate to a change, and so on. For now,   it just shows where the changes are.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/13/10: Release 0.104</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText1">Version 0.104 is available. It includes a whole raft of bug fixes aimed at   making GWE more stable and smoother to operate. Thanks to all the testers who   gave me help by finding problems.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">          The major new functionality in 104 is   the finished "NumPost" tab that can be found under Setup / Post. This tab lets   you heavily customize how G-Wizard handles the numbers associated with each word   to match your controller's requirements. It is modeled after the same   capabilities found in many CAM program post processors and in generic post   utilities like Posthaste.<BR>
          <BR>
          By default, number processing is set up to be   fairly lenient. But if you controller requires a decimal point at all times, or   perhaps leading zeroes (G02 instead of G2), this is the place to make that   happen.        Docs on the various post options including NumPost may be found here:<BR>
          <BR>

      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogDate">10/11/10: Release 0.103</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText1">Lots of usability tweaks to the debugger. That's the cluster of buttons that   looks like video playback used to control the backplot simulator. Now when you press the buttons, they do more, there   are tool tips, and there is feedback. Go ahead and have a play with them, as our   friends across the pond like to say.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Hints view now applies a pink background to lines having an error so it is   instantly obvious which ones do.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Lots more work done with the word   number parsing. Still not fully wired in, but the defaults are now being used   when parsing and will show up with errors. Still remaining is to let you edit   and save those defaults to fit the needs of your controller.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1"> Fixed a   bug in the tool loaded checking. When you do a feed speed move (G01, 02, or 03),   GWE assumes you mean to make some chips and verifies a tool is loaded, the   spindle is spinning, and the feedrate has been set.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">In addition to code   changes, there is now some simple documentation online. Try the Getting Started   page for starters (sorry!):<BR>
          <BR>

          <BR>
          Look for   more doc links either inline or in the navigation gutter on the left. There is   also a page talking about the wizards for creating g-code. I will try to get   some more pages done this week that document the debugger, menu commands, and   Setup Tool.
