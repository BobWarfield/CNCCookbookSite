      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="CCGWizardMachiningCalculator.html">G-Wizard's machining 
        calculator</a> is designed to help you determine<span class="BodyText"> the best feeds and speeds 
        for particular machining operations. </span></font><span class="BodyText">Getting the best feeds and speeds is one of the most important steps to ensure maximum material removal rates, <a href="MTMillSurfaceFinish.htm">best surface finishes</a>, and better tool life.  The Feeds and Speeds calculator considersmany additional variables that simple lookup tables and the SFM and chipload math every machinist knows by heart don't.     Considerations such as radial chip thinning, and when it's better to climb versus conventional mill are very important to getting the best results.</span>      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">If you're wondering why you'd care about all that, check out our <strong><a href="CCCNCMillFeedsSpeeds.htm">Feeds and Speeds Cookbook</a></strong>, there's a ton of good free information there on all aspects of feeds and speeds.</p>
<p><span class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To use the Feeds and Speeds calculator is</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> simple. Just  start filling in the form from  left to right, top to bottom and your answer comes out at the bottom:</font></p>

      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Machine</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, you select 
        your machine, the material, and the tool. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can set up each machine in your shop with information such 
        as the type of machine, machine's rpm limit, maximum feedrate, horsepower 
        of the spindle, and even what tooling is set up with the machine in the Tool Crib. If you haven't already done so, it's worth your time to set up the basic machine parameters using the <a href="GWCalcSetup.htm">Setup tab</a>.  This will ensure G-Wizard doesn't suggest a spindle speed or feedrate that are faster than your machine can handle, or a cut that takes more horsepower than your machine has available.     </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Save creating a custom Tool Crib for later, after you're familiar with the basics of G-Wizard.</font> </p>

      <p align="left" class="BodyText">There are two ways to enter a material. First is to use the Material list. Second is to use the Material Database, which is accessed via the &quot;More&quot; button next to the Material list.     The Material DB brings up a much more detailed list of materials that includes alloy and condition.   Here is a typical example after selecting low carbon steel from the  Materials list:</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizard/MaterialsDB.jpg" width="637" height="467"></p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText">Materials Database is organized by Family, Alloy, and Condition...</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">You can access any family from within the Materials Database with the &quot;Family&quot; pulldown.      Pick the alloy you want and its condition.      This determines the Hardness that G-Wizard will use to adjust the cutting parameters.  If you know the hardness of your material, all you need is the correct family and enter your own hardness.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When in doubt about which material to select (because you don't see your particular alloy on the list), choose one from the same family and similar hardness. By family, I mean Aluminum, Cast Iron, Stainless, Steel, etc.   Use the Hardness conversion table in the <a href="GWCalcQuickRef.htm">Quick Reference</a> if your hardness units are different than the BHN units listed above.  While the match is not exact, most tooling manufacturers make recommendations exactly this way and don't list recommendations for the thousands of different possible alloys that are out there.</font>  G-Wizard lists the hardness range for the current material right under the material selection menu.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">If you don't make a choice from the Materials DB, G-Wizard will assume an alloy and condition that falls in the middle of the range.     This works most of the time and there is enough conservatism built into GW that you're unlikely to damage a tool unless you're working on very hard material.  The purpose of the Materials DB is twofold. First, it is to help you in identifying the material more precisely.  Maybe you're not sure which family to choose, but if you can find it on the list, then you know.  Second, it provides a little fine tuning of the surface speed which may increase your performance if the material is software than the average or decrease and thereby increase tool life if the material is harder.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">If you're working with a material that isn't on the list, send us an email or bring it up on the User's Club.   We'll be happy to add your material.</p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depending on which 
        tool type you select, the remaining options may change. For example, if 
        you select one of the Twist Drills, you will be given the option of specifying 
        Parabolic flutes, which are useful for deep holes. You do not need to 
        specify how many flutes your Twist Drill has because G-Wizard assumes 
        they're always 2 flute. If you select an Endmill, you will have options 
        for Ballnose Cutters. If you select an Indexable End / Facemill, you have 
        the added option of specifying a lead angle, for example for a 45 degree 
        facemill.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first row

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- The Ballnose 
        Cutter checkbox does compensation for Ballnose cutters. Activating the 
        Ballnose Cutter checkbox will reveal more information about your ballnosed 
        cutter at the bottom of the Feeds and Speeds calculator. Speeds and feeds 
        differ because depth of cut changes the effective diameter of the cutter 
        on a ballnose. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- The Rougher 
        checkbox tells G-Wizard you have a &quot;Corncob&quot; rougher. These 
        are endmills that have a serrated edge. They can take a higher chipload 
        because they chop up the chips and make them a lot smaller.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- The Lead Angle 
        on Face Mills is the angle of the shoulder that would be cut. A straight 
        square shoulder is a 90 degree lead angle. Lead Angle also affects your 
        speeds and fees. You can feed a 45 degree Lead Angle cutter faster than 
        a 90 degree, and it will generally produce a nicer surface finish.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Twist Drills 
        have a &quot;Parabolic&quot; checkbox that specifies whether the drill 
        has parabolic flutes. </font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Taps have a &quot;Carbide&quot; and &quot;Form Tap&quot; checkbox that lets you specifies those options so you can get feeds and speeds for carbide taps and thread forming taps (form  taps).</p>

Many machinists are brought up on rules of thumb, trial and error, and what has worked in the past.    G-Wizard introduces the Cut Optimizer to help calculate more optimal depths and widths of cut based on an analysis of tool deflection.  It's possible to get much more scientific about your choice of width and depth of cut, and hence way better at choosing.

<p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/GWizard/GasPedal.jpg" width="800" height="716" alt="G-Wizard Gas Pedal"></p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The Gas Pedal is at the bottom, outlined in red...</p>
<p align="left" class="style1">The Gas Pedal is calibrated from Conservative to Aggressive in 4 steps.  The conservative end emphasizes Tool Life and Surface Finish.  The aggressive end emphasizes Material Removal Rates.   The Gas Pedal always comes up in position &quot;3&quot;, 1 notch below most aggressive, because that's how G-Wizard was calibrated before the Gas Pedal was introduced.</p>
<p align="left" class="style1">If you're a beginner, crank the Gas Pedal over to the conservative side until you're comfortable you've come up to speed. You might consider coming up a notch at a time.</p>
<p align="left" class="style1">If you're experienced, use the Gas Pedal to emphasize the difference between roughing and finishing.  Or, to give a job a little more safety margin.  For example, if you're down to your last cutter of a certain size and the job has to get done that day, be a little more conservative. If you want to emphasize a finer surface finish, be a little more conservative. If you are working on a job that's been going on for 2 weeks and would be expensive to start over on, be a little more conservative.</p>

You may need to be conservative about approaching your machine's HP limit.  I &quot;derate&quot; my HP by specifying a little less in the machine profile.   Also, some machines become less accurate at higher feedrates, and should only use the higher feedrates for rapids.    So you may want to derate the feedrate as well.</font>      </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Cutting Parameters Column</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second column 
        in this section is related to a deeper analysis of the cutting parameters:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Surface Speed 
        (SFM or SMM in Metric): This is a measure of how fast the tool is moving 
        relative to the material being cut. SFM is &quot;Surface Feet per Minute&quot; 
        and &quot;SMM is Surface Meters per Minute&quot;. If the tool were a wheel 
        rolling along the workpiece, that's how fast it would be rolling. SFM 
        is largely what determines tool life. If you exceed the recommended SFM, 
        you will wear out the tool much faster. If you run more slowly than recommended 
        SFM, you may extend the tool life.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- IPT: Inches 
        Per Tooth, also called Chipload. For metric, this is mm per tooth. To 
        maximize tool life, cut as close to the recommended chipload as possible 
        without going over. Exceeding the chipload will eventually break the tool. 
        Excessive SFM burns or wears out the tool, excessive chipload breaks the 
        tool.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- IPR: Inches 
        per revolution, or mm per revolution for metric. During the time it takes 
        for the spindle to make one revolution, this how far the workpiece must 
        move relative to the spindle to maintain the chipload given the number 
        of cutting flutes on the tool.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Chip Thinning 
        and AFPT: That business of &quot;Chip Thinning&quot; and &quot;AFPT&quot; 
        on the mill cutter screens is a High Speed Machining concept, but it matters 
        no matter what speed you are machining at. When you use less than half 
        of the total cutter diameter for your radial engagement, it turns out 
        you're not cutting full chip thickness. Hence the chip is &quot;thinned&quot;. 
        The idea behind these settings is to bump up the feed rate until you're 
        cutting full thickness chips again. Use the &quot;Chip Thinning&quot; 
        checkbox to turn this on and off. &quot;AFPT&quot; is the actual chip 
        thickness if you weren't using a chip thinning feedrate. Remember, cutting 
        a chip that is too thin will prematurely wear your cutter. Try to approach 
        the recommended chiploads by bumping up your feed. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chip 
        Thinning and AFPT also come into play if you are using a high lead angle 
        cutter. Similar geometric effects make the high lead angle (I don't know 
        why 45 is a &quot;high&quot; lead angle and 90 is not!) cutters require 
        more feed to maintain the recommended chipload.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><span class="BlogTitle">Material Removal Rates and HP Column</span></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the feeds 
        and speeds are determined, G-Wizard can estimate you material removal 
        rate (MRR) in cubic inches per minute (cubic mm/min for metric), how much 
        horsepower will be required, what % of your available maximum feedrate 
        and spindle speed are being used, and the recommended plunge rate for 
        endmills.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A lot of machinists 
        focus on maximizing MRR as a way of running their machines for optimal 
        productivity. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Something else 
        to think about: not all machines are equal in rigidity. Not even all setups 
        are equal. HP is a pretty good indicator of how much energy is being transferred 
        into the workpiece from a cutting operation. Since every action has an 
        equal and opposite reaction, that force is transferred back into the machine, 
        and the machine's rigidity has to fight to hold it in check. HP can be 
        a useful way to tell how stressful a cut is going to be. When you get 
        a feel for how many HP your machine can successfully transfer into a cut 
        for certain operations, you may want to use the HP Limit to scale back 
        a cut so that it is more in line with your machine's comfort zon<span class="BodyText">e.</span></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">And speaking of rigidity, you can see the predicted tool deflection for your cut (only for endmills and indexables) as well.</p>
      <p align="left"><span class="BlogTitle">Time Estimator Column</span></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Time Estimator 
        attempts to determine how long it will take to complete the machining 
        operation. It needs a few extra parameters:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Pass Length: 
        Pass length in inches or mm (for metric).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- XY Clearance: 
        Use this parameter to specify the distance the cutter must move while 
        not cutting, for example, to position for the next pass.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Passes: The 
        number of passes that will be made.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In exchange, it 
        will estimate how many minutes per pass are needed and how long the total 
        specified number of passes will take.</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">HSM Toolpaths</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&quot;HSM&quot; refers to &quot;High Speed Machining&quot;, a collection of modern techniques designed to wring maximum performance out of CNC machine tools.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">The HSM section provides several tools for dealing with the effects of Tool Engagement Angles (also called Cutter Engagement Angles). The TEA provides a means of measuring how hard a cut is working the cutter.  Think of it as the angle of the cutter that is actually engaged in cutting.  For example, when slotting, a full 180 degrees is engaged.  This is the maximum, except during plunging, when a full 360 degrees may engage. TEA changes as a function of corners the cutter may be forced to negotiate in a complex toolpath for CNC.   If you don't use CNC, the TEA functions are probably not important to your work.   </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">This portion of the G-Wizard Calculator enables you to do the following:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Calculate the straightline TEA based on tool diameter and cut width.   To do so, just press the &quot;Const. TEA&quot; button and you'll see it come up.  For example, a 1/2&quot; endmill cutting 0.015&quot; width of cut has a TEA of 19 degrees--much less than the 180 degrees when full slotting!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Estimate the TEA of a toolpath based on tool diameter, cut width, and the sharpest angled corner in the path.   To bring up the TEA Estimator, press the &quot;Est. TEA&quot; button.  Here is our 1/2&quot; endmill, 0.015&quot; cut width example with a 90 degree corner:</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText"><img src="img/GWizard/EstTEA.jpg" width="671" height="601"></p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText">Estimating the TEA of a 1/2&quot; EM with a 0.015&quot; width of cut in a 90 degree corner...</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">When estimating TEA's, you're stuck using the worst case corner since you presumably have a conventional toolpath and not a constant TEA toolpath.   You'll be surprised at how much corners increase your TEA.  The example cut went from a paltry 19 degrees all the way to 109 degrees in a 90 degree corner, for example.  The estimator will show you a scale drawing of the cutter and the corner to help visualize what's happening.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Estimate how much you'd need to slow down in a 90 degree corner versus &quot;straight line&quot; performance.   Any machinist has seen cases where corners cause problems with chatter or perhaps even breaking or chipping a corner.   The &quot;Corner Adjust&quot; number tells you how much slower you'd have to go through a 90 degree corner versus straightline with a given tool diameter and cut width.  To determine the slowdown, press &quot;Const. TEA&quot; first so you have a straightline TEA, and then look at the &quot;Corner Adjust&quot;.   For our example, we'd have to slow a path optimized for straight line to just 17% of the MRR of the straight line path. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-    Calculate how much faster a constant engagement angle toolpath (HSM) can run than a &quot;standard&quot; toolpath.  Calculate the standard feeds and speeds as you always would, press &quot;Const. TEA&quot;, and read off the &quot;HSM Adjust&quot;.  Like &quot;Corner Adjust&quot;, this is an increase in MRR.   Press the &quot;Show HSM Feeds and Speeds&quot; checkbox to update RPM and IPM accordingly.  Our light TEA angle example (1/2&quot; EM, 0.015&quot; cut width) goes from a speed of 3805 rpm and 76.5 IPM to a blistering 6946 rpm and 382 IPM with an HSM toolpath because the MRR went up 500% Now you know why they can charge more for that feature in a CAM program!</p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The feeds and 
        speeds calculator also does calculations for ballnosed cutters. These 
        cutters are unique because their diameter depends on how far down the 
        ball you are cutting, which complicates the feed and speed calculation. 
        Simply click the &quot;Ballnose Cutter&quot; checkbox to turn on ballnose 
        compensation. It's located next to where you enter the number of flutes 
        and only appears for tool types that could be ball nosed. Turning on this 
        option will display some additional values near the bottom of the calculator 
        that tell you the effective diameter of the tool for a given depth of 
        cut and that also let you calculate what stepover to use to get a certain 
        scallop height. When 3D profiling, the scallop height gives you some idea 
        of the smoothness of the surface. Note that this calculation assumes a 
        flat surface. You may be profiling a wall at an angle, which will result 
        in a different value. I need to set the calculator up to deal with that, 
        but haven't gotten around to it yet. The computation simply involves multiplying 
        the values given by the cosine of the angle of the material. Of course 
        the cosine of 0 degrees is &quot;1&quot;, hence this calculation is right 
        for flat horizontal surfaces.</font></p>

      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Mini-Calcs</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G-Wizard's feeds and speeds 
        calculator has a set of functions called &quot;Mini-Calcs&quot; that <span class="style1">are little popup feeds and speeds calculators for special situations</span>:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Parameter 
        Locking and Overrides</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the parameters 
        sometimes have a little padlock next to them, for example there is one 
        next to the Surface Speed parameter. The padlock only appears when the 
        parameter has been overridden by the user. Let's say G-Wizard is recommending 
        400 SFM for your Surface Speed, and you think that's too fast. You can 
        simply type &quot;200&quot; into that field and override the recommendation. 
        Once you've overridden, the field stays overridden until you click the 
        padlock, press the &quot;Reset to Defaults&quot; button (which resets 
        all padlocks), or restart G-Wizard.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that there 
        are some good reasons not to leave parameters locked for very long. Many 
        of them interact with one another. For example, let's say you want to 
        look at the MRR and HP for various sized cutters. You decide to override 
        SFM because you prefer a lower value. However, G-Wizard tweaks SFM depending 
        on cut depth and cut width relative to cutter diameter. So as you're playing 
        with larger and smaller endmill diameters, you're missing out on that 
        tweaking.</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Using the Cut Knowledge Base</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">The Cut Knowledge Base (Cut KB) is a powerful feature normally only found in high end CAM packages where it is often referred to under the heading of &quot;knowledge based programming&quot;.  The idea behind the Cut KB is to facilitate the gathering and organization of your shop's best practices around cutting to create a Knowledge Base (similar to a database) that captures that experience.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">See the <a href="GWCalcCutKB.html">Cut Knowledge Base documentation page</a> for more information.</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">What 
        is Chip Thinning?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chip thinning 
        is the tendency for the chips to get thinner when you cut less than half 
        the cutter's diameter depth of cut at a particular feedrate (more detail on my <a href="CCChipThinning.htm">chip thinning page</a>).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider a cutter 
        that is 1/2&quot; in diameter edge milling a 1/4&quot; deep depth of cut. 
        Further, let's say it is spinning at 2700 rpm at a recommended feedrate 
        of 16 IPM. So, for 1/2 of a revolution, a tooth is engaged in the cut. 
        That 1/2 revolution takes 0.000185 minutes. During that time, the 16 IPM 
        feedrate moves the cutter 0.003&quot;, which is the recommended chipload 
        for the cutter.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let's try 
        less depth of cut. Instead of 1/4&quot; deep, let's go 1/8&quot; deep, 
        half as much cut. We can use the chord calculator in G-Wizard to see how 
        much engagement we have. The arc length is 0.5236&quot;, and the overall 
        circumference of the cutter is 1.5708&quot;, so we are engaging only 1/3 
        of the total circumference instead of the 1/2 with the deeper cut. So 
        the cutter now has even less time to peel of a chip, hence it has a lower 
        chipload. The actual chipload is now than what it should be. Hence, we 
        can speed up the feedrate quite a bit to restore the recommended chipload. 
        G-Wizards's &quot;AFPT&quot; is the &quot;Adjusted Feed Per Tooth&quot;, 
        and it is the chipload at this faster feedrate.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that G-Wizard's 
        Chip Thinning compensation is radial chip thinning. Axial chip thinning 
        is also possible, but is based on the cutter's profile being something 
        other than vertical. For example, button cutters are like face mills that 
        have round inserts. The ballnosed cutter compensation compensates for 
        the round profile of a ballnosed cutter, but assumes a semicircle rather 
        than the radius of a button cutter. Certain insert types (high feed inserts) 
        also use this kind of geometry to allow extremely high feed<span class="BodyText">rates.</span></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">The danger when running light cuts and feeds and speeds that don't take chip thinning into account is that your cutter will &quot;rub&quot;, which drastically reduces tool life!</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">The Case 
        for Parabolic Drills and Some New G-Wizard Functionality</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is always hard to drill 
        deep holes, where deep is defined by a hole that is many diameters of 
        the drill bit deep. I recently came across <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?p=686096#post686096">a 
        question on CNCZone</a> that started me doing some research on the topic 
        of parabolic drills. Parabolic-style drills were developed in the early 
        1980s. They use a heavier web to create higher rigidity and increased 
        flute area for chip removal on deep-hole drilling operations. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Precision Twist Drill has <a href="http://www.precisiontwistdrill.com/techhelp/article08281995.asp?image=contact">a 
        nice discussion</a> on their site of how to vary feeds and speeds to accomodate 
        deep holes when using regular and parabolic twist drills. I was so taken 
        by the CNCZoner's question and that nice discussion that I wound up adding 
        a bunch of functionality to my <a href="FeedSpeedsCalculator/CCGWizard.html">G-Wizard Machinist's 
        Calculator</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new functionality is both 
        to implement the feeds and speeds adjustments recommended by Precision 
        Twist for deep holes, but also to give recommendations based on the hole 
        depth. For example, it suggests when you need to use a peck drilling cycle 
        (where you drill down a little ways and then retract to clear chips) as 
        well as when you should be considering a parabolic bit instead of a regular 
        twist drill.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question the CNCZoner raised 
        was what feeds and speeds to use when drilling a 0.201&quot; hole 3.5&quot; 
        deep. That's over 17x the diameter in depth, so a parabolic drill is definitely 
        called for!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is what G-Wizard shows 
        when you enter those parameters:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/Blog/Parabolic1.jpg" width="800" height="715"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note the box for 
        Parabolic is checked, which tells G-Wizard we want to use a parabolic 
        drill. Also, it is recommending a peck drilling cycle (DUH!) for this 
        17.412x Diameter hole depth. If we enter a less severe hole depth, 0.2&quot;, 
        it recommends 3800 rpm and a feed of 16.85, whereas you can see from the 
        diagram it has compensated for hole depth and slowed down both the feeds 
        and speeds. The feed is slowed as a result of the spindle rpm. Parabolics 
        don't need further slowing. A regular twist drill would also get feedrate

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many CNC'ers are 
        brought up on the notion that you should always Climb mill because it 
        leaves a better surface finish, requires less energy, and is less likely 
        to deflect the cutter. Conversely, manual machinists are often taught 
        never to climb mill because it's dangerous to do on a machine that has 
        backlash. The truth is somewhere in the middle. ABTools, makers of the 
        popular AlumaHog and ShearHog cutters, point out <a href="http://www.abtoolsinc.com/metalcuttingmyths/metalcuttingmyths.htm">some 
        worthwhile rules of thumb</a>:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- One cutting 
        half the cutter diameter or less, you should definitely climb mill (assuming 
        your machine has low or no backlash and it is safe to do so!).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Up to 3/4 of 
        the cutter diameter, it doesn't matter which way you cut.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- When cutting 
        from 3/4 to 1x the cutter diameter, you should prefer conventional milling.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reason is 
        that cutter geometry forces the equivalent of negative rake cutting for 
        those heavy 3/4 to 1x diameter cuts. It seems that Dapra corporation first 
        discussed this phenomenon way back in 1971. G-Wizard now reminds you with 
        a little hint which one you should prefer:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/GWizard/GWizClimbHint.jpg" width="512" height="148"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just to the 
        right of Radial Engagement it says, &quot;Use Climb Milling&quot;...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose 
        to climb mill, do make sure your machine is up to it from the standpoint 
        of having low or no backlash, lest your cutter dig in and suddenly jump 
        very deeply into the cut due to the backlash.</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Exploring Ramping and Interpolated Holes with G-Wizard's New Mini-Calcs</p>
      <p class="style1">I've just finished adding a new feature to the <a href="FeedSpeedsCalculator/CCGWizard.html">G-Wizard Calculator</a> that I call &quot;Mini-Calcs&quot; for release 1.040.  Mini-Calcs are little popup feeds and speeds calculators for special situations.  We already had one popup for calculating ballnose cutter stepover to achieve a particular surface finish.  I've just added two more--one is all about interpolated holes and the other is about ramping.  Both are common CNC operations that may be used to get a cutter down into a pocket or in the case of interpolation, this is an effective way to use an endmill to create a hole of a particular size.  There are a lot of trade-offs around making holes with interpolation, but more on those in a moment.</p>
      <p class="style1">The Mini-Calcs are accessed directly under the Tool Definition (where you specify tool diameter, flutes, and so on):</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/GWizard/GWMiniCalcs.jpg" width="800" height="706" alt="G-Wizard Mini-Calcs"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">The three Mini-Calc buttons are right under where you specify Tool Diameter and Flutes...</p>
      <p class="style1">Let's start with the Ramping Mini-Calc.  From the screen shot above you can see I've set up an aggressive machining scenario in 6061 aluminum.  I've got a 1/2&quot; 3-flute TiAlN Endmill selected and it's a serrated &quot;corncob&quot; rougher to boot.   I want to set up my CAM program to cut a pocket on a part, and I've decided my entry to the pocket will be via ramp.  I'll show how to use the Ramp Mini-Calc to solve a couple of interesting problems. </p>
      <p class="style1">First, let's say I just plan to ramp down at some &quot;standard&quot; rate, say a 3 degree angle.  What should my feeds and speeds be on that ramp?   You should adjust your feeds and speeds slightly when ramping because its harder than making a level cut.  Let's say we'll be cutting our pocket at a 1/2&quot; depth.  Set up  for a full slot cut, because the ramp will be descending into bare metal.  Let's also set the depth of cut to be the maximum depth of the ramp in one pass. If we need to go deeper to get down to full cut depth, the ramp will zig zag back and forth. I'll use a 1/2&quot; depth of cut at full ramp. Here is the Ramp Mini-Calc with all that keyed in:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/GWizard/GWRampMC.jpg" width="500" height="311" alt="Ramping the Cut Down 3 Degrees"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">Ramping the Cut Down 3 Degrees...</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">As you can see, with a 3 degree ramp, the adjustment in feedrate is pretty minor, from 108.6'ish IPM down to 106.  No biggie, in fact we could probably just choose to ignore it unless we're running a really max'ed out feedrate we've determined through trial and error to be right at the ragged edge.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">What if we want to see what angle is needed to get all the way down the ramp in say 2&quot; of travel?  No problem.  Set your depth of cut as before to the bottom of the ramp, bring up the Ramp Mini-Calc and press &quot;From Cut Depth&quot;.  You'll see a new control appear that wants to know the travel length.  We're trying to get there in 2&quot;, so fill that in:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/GWizard/GWRampMC2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="303"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">You need a 14 degree angle to ramp down 1/2&quot; in a 2&quot; pass...</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The Ramping Mini-Calc figures the ramp angle at 14 degrees. This is more aggressive than the 3 degrees we had earlier, so we have to cut our feedrate from 108.6 IPM down to about 97 IPM. That's starting to be worth worrying about in the CAM program. You can just click &quot;Adjust Feedrate&quot; and the Mini-Calc will override G-Wizard's default calculated feedrate based on the new information on ramp angle.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">This is a probably a good time to mention the warning you see there.  Not all cutters can tolerate arbitrary ramp angles.  For example, let's say we had a 90 degree ramp angle. That would be a straight plunge.  Obviously if you don't have a center-cutting endmill, that's a no-no!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Insertable tooling will have a ramp angle limitation that you can find in the manufacturer's catalog.  It's often pretty limiting, so be sure you don't find out the hard way you have exceeded it!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">What about the Interpolation Mini-Calc?   Let's check it out:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Suppose you want to use the same basic setup to interpolate a 2&quot; hole.  Click on the Interpolate Mini-Calc and here's what you'll see:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/GWizard/GWInterpMC.jpg" width="500" height="441" alt="Helical and Circular Interpolation Calculator"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">The Helical and Circular Interpolation Mini-Calc...</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">There's quite a bit more going on here as you can see. First, you'll need to specify whether you're machining a hole or a boss.  This determines whether the endmill is going around an ID or an OD diameter.  In addition, the checkbox tells whether Tool Comp is in use, in which case the toolpath is the cutting edge rather than center of tool.   We also need to tell whether we will be doing a Helical Interpolation (going down the hole in a spiral) or a Circular Interpolation (just machine from center out without changing the Z depth).   Lastly, we enter our Feature Diameter, which we said would be a 2&quot; hole. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Now the Mini-Calc displays a series of intermediate results:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">-  The raw unadjusted feedrate coming in from G-Wizard is 108.6 IPM again.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Since we're doing a Helical Interpolation, there is a ramp angle. We figured it out from the Cut Depth parameter. You could also have used the ramp calculator to go from degrees to cut depth.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">-  We need to adjust for the geometry of both the ramp and the fact that unless we have tool comp on, our feedrate is based on a radius that is either larger (boss) or smaller (hole) than our feature.  As we can see, the geometry adjust feedrate is signicantly different in this case, coming in at 77.8 IPM.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">What's all this business of acceleration?  Thought you'd never ask!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Not long ago I was chatting with a moldmaker about the pros and cons of interpolation versus a honking indexable drill to open up a hole before pocketing. He wasn't having any of it because he needed a bunch of hole sizes in his molds and he needed them to be done accurately via interpolation.  And, he wanted G-Wizard to do the interpolation calculations, and BTW, the feedrates it was giving him were too fast for his machine to interpolate accurately (I related the story in more detail in <a href="http://cnccookbook.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/interpolate-or-twist-drill-part-deaux-making-holes-not-pockets/">a prior blog post</a>).  After thinking about the issue for quite some while, I finally realized the answer to the accuracy issue was in figuring out the acceleration required for the op and making sure it was within the machine's capabilities.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">As you can see, the operation depicted by the screen shot requires 0.03 g's of acceleration, which is 4034.5 inches per minute per minute. That's not very challenging for most machines.  A high-end machine purpose-built for HSM with linear servos may be able to do 5 g's of acceleration.  The vast majority of machines are only capable of a tiny fraction of that kind of performance.  You can check your manufacturer's specifications, but I have more bad news--the exact acceleration capabilities can vary fairly significantly from one machine to the next, particularly if they're not right off the assembly line.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The thing to do if you want to be able to interpolate holes and other features accurately is to measure your machine's capability in this regard.  Mastercam <a href="http://www.mastercam.com/Support/Downloads/Mastercam8/Files/hfapp_v8.doc">has a document</a> out that walks through how to go about this with their software.  Or, you can use G-Wizard's Interpolation Mini-Calc to figure it out.  Here's how:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">1.   Pick a test diameter.  Smaller is better because its easier to generate higher accelerations going round and round real fast in a little hole!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">2.  Set up the Interpolation Mini-Calc for circular interpolation on your small hole. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">3.  Now go run tests on your machine until you've figured out the fastest feedrate that interpolates that hole accurately.  Plug that feedrate into the Mini-Calc and it'll tell you how many g's that was.    Write that down!  Eventually I will add a field to the Machine Profiles in G-Wizard so it'll remember it for future interpolation calculations.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Just as an example, let's say we machine 1/2&quot; bosses with a 1/4&quot; EM.  I like bosses for these tests because we can get a micrometer on one to accurately measure it.  Holes are more trouble.  Given a Cut Depth of 0.2&quot; and a 15% of diameter Cut Width for that boss, G-Wizard has us going round and round at 178 IPM on our 7500 rpm limited spindle.  That gives us an acceleration of 0.3 g's.  Believe it or not, that's probably heading into the pain threshold for an older VMC that doesn't have the swiftest rapids in the Wild West.   So let's say we wind up having to slow it down to 120 IPM before we hit our tolerances.  With just a little fiddling in G-Wizard around the Interpolation Calculator, we discover that means our limit is 0.15 g's. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">If you're just hogging a hole to get a pocket started, don't sweat the acceleration limits. There is a checkbox to turn the feature off.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Incidentally, going around a corner on a toolpath will be subject to the same kinds of acceleration limits.  You'll want to map these limits out for a couple of hole sizes to see how stable they are for your machine.  Keep careful notes, they'll come in handy when you're trying to dial in that high dollar job.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Okay. You've now seen how we can use the Ramping and Interpolation Mini-Calcs in G-Wizard to solve some interesting machining problems.  Go forth, be fruitful, and make some chips!</p>
