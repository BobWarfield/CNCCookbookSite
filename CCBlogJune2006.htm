      <p class="BlogTitle">Digitizing a Quarter</p>
      <p>Have you ever wondered about those digitizing probes you can put on a 
        CNC machine? <a href="http://www.imsrv.com/deskcnc/Scanning%20a%20quarter.htm">I 
        came across an article on using one to scan a quarter that provides a 
        great introduction to them</a>. This particular article is by the DeskCNC 
        people who are using their software together with an IMServices scanning 
        probe. Basically, the hot glued a quarter to a metal plate and went at 
        it:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="http://www.imsrv.com/deskcnc/Scanning%20a%20quarter.htm"><img src="img/OthersProjects/ScanQuarter.jpg" width="338" height="346" border="0"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>Quarter hot glued to plate and scanning probe approacing...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">The process involved scanning an area slightly under 1&quot; 
        square and required 3.5 hours to produce a 3D model involving 95,000 points 
        scanned. The result is pretty impressively detailed:</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="http://www.imsrv.com/deskcnc/Scanning%20a%20quarter.htm"><img src="img/OthersProjects/ScanQuarter2.jpg" width="587" height="589" border="0"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>The scanned 3D model...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">Check out these IMServices guys. Their prices seem very 
        reasonable, especially given the quality of the results and what looks 
        like a very slick piece of software to automate the probing.  
        I suppose you could also haunt eBay looking for Rennishaw probes, but 
        you'd have to figure out to interface one if you got it. I doubt you'll 
        find one much cheaper than IMServices offer, and the condition will likely 
        be undertermined given it's eBay.</p>
      <p><b class="BlogDate">6/25/06</b></p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">PC Chassis for CNC Lathe Conversion</p>
      <p> Did a little mill work on my pc chassis for the lathe. I'm building 
        a little Micro ATX Athlon system, which is way overkill for this application, 
        but for a new mobo and cpu, it was still pretty cheap. I'm planning to 
        try to focus on this chassis and get the little pc up and running first 
        so I can install software and so on. I'm converting a rack unit I got 
        off eBay to house the pc, and I will use a second identical rack unit 
        to house the GRex, Geckos, DC power supply, relays, and so forth. I used 
        the IH mill to make some cutouts on the back of the chassis. I made one 
        for the power supply and one all the cables will go through. We only really 
        need 4 cables--Keyboard, Mouse, Video, and LAN, but I made it big enough 
        for any concievable connections. I am planning to use a sort of rubber 
        flap over it to keep the chips out. I think this is better than individually 
        bezelling all the connectors out the back because I think the typical 
        PC connectors are chip vulnerable. I will also try to &quot;harden&quot; 
        the power supply against chips by putting a filter on the back of it. 
        We'll see whether this chassis calls for a cooling fan, but if so, I will 
        use a filter for it too.</p>
      <p>It sure was fun making those cutouts on the back with the mill. I was 
        cutting thin aluminum with a small 4 flute mill at maximum spindle speed. 
        It just cut through like butter and left a very nice surface finish. Of 
        course, before I could do all of this I had to line up my Kurt 6&quot; 
        vise on the table and install a new set of jaws in it. Seems like there 
        is always something slowing you down, eh? Well that big 6&quot; vise is 
        sure heavy compared to the Kurt 4&quot; I normally leave on the table. 
        It did the job though.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Phase II Rotary Table Tips</p>
      <p>Here is another important tip. I got a Phase II 8&quot; rotary table 
        just a little while ago from <a href="http://www.getmachiningtools.com/">Kap 
        Pullen</a>. He is a regular contributor to the various boards I read and 
        a heck of a nice guy with some great prices. Anyway, I found out after 
        I got it that the darned thing doesn't use the same 5/8&quot; T-slots 
        as my mill. It looks just under 1/2&quot;. Kap says the spec sheet calls 
        for 0.465&quot;. So, I had to go looking for a 1/2&quot; clamping set 
        to order. If you're buying a rotab, be sure to check into what sort of 
        clamp set you need or you'll be wondering how to put it to use after you 
        get it!</p>
      <p>Another tip for that table. I had some 2&quot; Kant-Twist clamps, and 
        it seems they engage the T-slots perfectly. This was a convenient way 
        to clamp my PC chassis to the rotab so I could mill some fan holes.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Holy Spinning Tombstones, Batman!</p>
      <p>Saw this intriguing idea in a <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21918">thread 
        over on CNCZone</a> today:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/4thAxisTombstone.jpg" width="640" height="427"></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>4th Axis Tombstone...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">The idea is to be able to mount parts on at least 2 and 
        preferably 4 sides of the spinning tombstone and then let the mill go 
        to work on them, flipping to a new side whenever it finishes the parts 
        on one side. Hard to see how this is faster than just loading sub-plates 
        onto the main fixture plate unless you need to leave the machine unattended 
        for quite a while. Anyway, I do enjoy learning tips for how the pros would 
        go about manufacturing something using CNC tools.</p>

      <p><b class="BlogTitle">Tramming Jack</b></p>
      <p> I came across this interesting concept recently, a &quot;tramming jack&quot;:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/TrammingJack.jpg" width="768" height="576"></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>Tramming Jack...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">Let me try to explain what's going on here. This fellow 
        is using the little machinist's jack together with the big square frame 
        he welded up to make fine adjustments to the tram of his mill head. The 
        jack gives him a fine adjustment screw for the task. I thought this was 
        an interesting alternative to hammer thumping while the locking screws 
        are half tightened, which is how I learned to do it. Perhaps one could 
        fabricate a more elegant approach using a fine screw secured to the head 
        and the mill table. Imagine a sort of turnbuckle arrangement. OTOH, maybe 
        it would just be very inconvenient compared to the hammer. I'll have to 
        give it some thought.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">A Chip Compactor for the Shop</p>
      <p> There is an <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21433&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15">interesting 
        discussion over on the CNCZone about building a chip compactor</a> with 
        a 30 ton hydraulic ram to make recycling chips easier. The idea is to 
        compress them into &quot;pucks&quot; so they take less space and so the 
        coolant can be forced out for recycling. I drew up a quick Rhino rendering 
        to try to visualize what they were talking about:</p>

        enters from above. Purple is a gate at the bottom that opens so the puck 
        can drop through. The series of holes in the green base plate allows coolant 
        to run out a separate path for recycling.</p>

      <p>I have been interested in heat treating metals for a long time, and finally 
        sat down to do a little web research on how to build a heat treat furnace. 
        Industrial PID controllers are readily available on eBay cheap, and the 
        rest of the materials required are not expensive either. If you wanted 
        to buy a heat treating oven, you should look at units made by Paragon 
        Kilns. The knife making community seems to swear by these units. Depending 
        on the model you choose, they run from $1200-ish to as much as $4000:</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Apply Your Own Ceramic Coatings to Headers</p>
      <p>I'm always interested in industrial finishes for parts, not sure why, 
        I just am. I came across this interesting article on applying ceramic 
        coatings to engine headers: <a href="http://www.customclassictrucks.com/techarticles/137_0312_cerm/">http://www.customclassictrucks.com/techarticles/137_0312_cerm/</a>. 
        It turns out there are quite a few different functional coatings like 
        this that can be applied in the home shop, including Dry Film Lubricants, 
        Thermal Barrier coatings, Thermal Dispersants, and Corrosion- and Chemical-Resistance 
        coatings. In this case, the ceramic coating on these headers is applied 
        with nothing more than an automotive touch-up spray gun. Mind you, spraying 
        the coating is the easy part. To make it work you will need to be able 
        to bake at up to 600 degrees.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Garage CNC Business</p>
      <p>Aside from finishes, I'm also interested whenever I come across a small 
        CNC business: </p>

      <p> First, a nifty accessory for moving your vise on and off your mill table:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/MillViseSwingArm1.jpg" width="512" height="384"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/MillViseSwingArm2.jpg" width="512" height="384"></p>
      <p align="left">It's so nicely made, isn't it? You clamp the vice jaws onto 
        the thing and you can lift the vise off and swing it out of the way. It 
        almost seems to me like something slightly more general would let you 
        keep a bunch of vises, rotary tables, and other goodies on a shelf behind 
        the mill and bring them on and off as needed. You can by one already made 
        from SPI (via MSC or other dealer) which calls the product a &quot;Mill 
        Vise Caddy.&quot; Cost, $339. I'd say it's well worth making one, and 
        have added it to my <a href="MTWishListFutures.htm">project list</a>.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Shop Made CNC Hydraulic Tubing Bender</p>
      <p align="left">Second, may I present one of the most impressive projects 
        I've yet seen? This fellow chip has made an NC-controlled hydraulic tubing 
        bender from scratch. He's a MechE student at Cal Poly, and it is just 
        the coolest project ever.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="http://www.offroadfabnet.com/forums/showthread.php?t=218"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/bender1.jpg" width="650" height="491" border="0"></a></p>

      <p align="left">I wish I could say I was adding this one to my project list, 
        but truthfully, it looks too ambitious for me at the moment. Maybe someday 
        when I have more time and experience I will revisit. Meanwhile, I just 
        enjoy reading the thread he's written.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Mirror Fixtures for Small Production Runs</p>
      <p align="left">Onward to some less ambitious, but still interesting findings. 
        Here is a clever idea for small production runs:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/CNCBusiness/NegativeImageSpaceForFlip.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>Flip fixture is at top, half machined parts in middle, 
        finished parts at bottom...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">The idea is a special fixture to make it easier to machine 
        the back side of a bunch of parts. The parts are laid out 6 to a piece 
        of metal. First you mill out the top half. Then you flip the piece over, 
        dropping it into the &quot;flip&quot; fixture on the vice. It is a precise 
        negative image of the parts, which holds them in place, and allows you 
        to machine the backside of said parts. When done, you dump the finished 
        parts out of the flip fixture and go again. Neat, eh?</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Mill Tramming Bar</p>
      <p align="left">Okay, here is another super simple idea that would be an 
        easy project. It's a tramming bar for a mill:</p>

        collet chuck that a fellow from Practical Machinist named &quot;j king&quot; 
        made</a>. It uses a planetary gearset from a transmission to gear down 
        the handwheel in a compact way and tighten the thread on the collet. The 
        handwheel is nicer than the keyed 5C chuck I've got (and which I still 
        need to make a backplate for!). Other detail notes: there is an O-ring 
        to keep the handwheel from rattling, and there is a sleeve pressed into 
        the small gear. Since the transmission gears are hardened, the sleeve 
        was necessary to allow threading for the 5C collet. It is brazed into 
        place. The workmanship and sheer beauty of it is amazing:</p>

      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Servo for Lathe Spindle</p>
      <p align="left">In the category of &quot;Food for Thought&quot;, I am considering 
        what it would take to get servo drive of my lathe spindle. There are two 
        approaches I can see. First is to buy a 1KW (roughly 1HP) or more servo 
        and use it directly. Second would be to <a href="http://truetex.com/servomod.htm">add 
        an encoder to the existing DC motor</a>, thereby converting it to a servo. 
        The link I give for converting a motor looks promising to me. However, 
        the gang on CNCZone had a fairly dim view of it initially. The feeling 
        was that it wouldn't do well holding still because of cogging effects 
        on the motor. One fellow did opine that he was experimenting with a similar 
        rig to good result. I think in the end of the day I'll just have to try 
        an experiment. Now why, you ask, would I want to do this? If I can reliably 
        index the spindle, in other words get it to stop at a precise orientation, 
        I can use it as an additional CNC axis to good effect. Imagine mounting 
        a drill to the QCTP. With precise control of where the spindle stops together 
        with the cross slide, I can now position the drill to any point on a faced 
        surface. The final axis allows me to drill a hole. With this kind of capability, 
        I could turn out NEMA 23 step motor adapters that are cylindrical in one 
        setup, simply by changing to the drill fixture as the last step to drill 
        the 4 motor mount holes. Likewise, drilling holes perpendicular to a shaft 
        would be easy as well. A 3-in-1 machine would be particularly powerful 
        because an indexable spindle instantly creates a 4-axis milling machine. 
        In any event, encoders are pretty cheap. When I get the lathe converted 
        to CNC, perhaps I'll buy a Gecko servo drive and an encoder to experiment 
        with. I have a spare identical DC motor to the one on the lathe. It might 
        prove a very worthwhile line of inquiry!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Cooling Box for Air Hardening Steel</p>
      <p align="left">Okay, my last note is a quickie. I came across this nifty 
        cooling box for air hardening steel:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/AirHardenCoolingCabinet.gif" width="263" height="263"></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>Cooling Box for Air Hardening Steel...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">It's just a simple rack with a box fan sitting on top of 
        it directing air down through a grate. This would be great if you were 
        doing some kind of small manufacturing run of parts made of air hardened 
        steel. It's useless for annealing, as you need to cool very slowly in 
        that case--the cooling rate is very critical. The book says 40&deg;F/h 
        from 1600-1650. That's 20-24 hours at a steady rate to still be 200&deg;F. 
        The non-magnetic point being 1425&deg;F appears to be too low to anneal. 
        H-13 is one air hardening steel. To heat treat, heat it until it is non-magnetic. 
        Wrapping the part in foil is preferred if you have a forge or furnace 
        in which to do the heating. Cool it down in air. Reheat to 1100 degrees 
        F to temper, which should leave it a nice plum color. D2 and D7 are two 
        other air hardening steels.</p>

      <p align="left">I'm not saying its cost effective,<a href="http://www.cnconabudget.com/">this 
        one can be bought for $10</a>, but I like the idea of designs that incorporate 
        a flex coupler into some other part. Check the rotary table conversion 
        down below to see what I mean. The style pictured above looks straightforward 
        to cut with my DeWalt Multicutter carbide saw. Or you could use a slitting 
        saw. Probably want some sort of hardened steel to make sure it is springy. 
        I like this idea because I think you can simplify your design by incorporating 
        the flex coupler into another part rather than having to come up with 
        an independent coupler. This approach can also result in a more compact 
        design. </p>

      <p>Ran across another interesting gadget--there are so many in the machining 
        world! This one is an electrolytic weld cleaner. The idea is to remove 
        discoloration from steel caused by welding heat using electrolytic action. 
        Apparently they are nothing more than a 40V DC supply applied to the work 
        using a sponge that's been dipped in some form of acid, usually phosphoric. 
        Commercial units are very expensive, about $800 - $1000:</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.screenpro.net/weld.htm">http://www.screenpro.net/weld.htm</a></p>
      <p>Sure seems to me like a <a href="MTLatheCNCDrivers.htm">stepper-motor 
        DC supply</a> would be cheap to build (&lt;$100) and perfect to produce 
        a homemade weld cleaner with. Apparently these commercial units rely on 
        fiberglass tape, held on with electrical tape, to act as their sponge. 
        I'm envisioning a wand with the fiberglass tape on positive (have to check 
        that !) and a welding-style ground clamp. Supposedly the ScreenPro wand 
        was made from a piece of flattened copper pipe (high tech, eh?). I've 
        got too many projects right now to mess with this, but will keep it in

      <p align="left">I got interested in tapping heads, and so made a few notes 
        based on my web research:</p>
      <p align="left"> 
      <ul>
        <li> They run at around 500 rpm, and reverse themselves when you let up 
          on the quill pressure.</li>
        <li>You can use a combination drill/tap to drill and tap the hole in a 
          single operation for production purposes.</li>
        <li>Use a spiral tip tap to push the chips down (tapping a through hole) 
          or a spiral flute tap to push the chips up (blind hole). Spiral flute 
          taps are a little weaker than straight taps.</li>
        <li>With care, you can power tap without a tapping head. Set your spindle 
          as slow as it will go (&lt;100 rpm, say 80 rpm), bring it down manually 
          with the quill until the tap grabs, and then let go. When it has gone 
          as far as you like, reverse the spindle, and use a little pressure (not 
          much!) on the quill so that the top threads aren't pulled out. It is 
          suggested to use a keyless chuck on this operation to hold the tap, 
          and to tighten just enough so the tap can slip if there is too much 
          torque, short of breaking the tap. Take care not to slip too much or 
          the tap shank will be damaged. Note that these threads are less accurate 
          than those formed with a tapping head and will not pass a Go-NoGo gauge 
          test. </li>
        <li>You can also use a cordless drill to power tap.</li>
        <li>3 flute taps are recommended over 2 flute because they start truer 
          and cut smoother.</li>
        <li>Use a good tapping lubricant! TapHeavy or Cintap are recommended for 
          aluminum over TapMagic. TapMagic is good for steel.</li>
        <li>Use a cold forming tap for non-ferrous metals (aluminum) and even 
          mild steels (under 30-35C). They produce no chips. Some say not to use 
          them for cast aluminum or Mic-6.</li>
        <li>One fellow recommends chamfering the holes before starting to tap. 
          I like that idea.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'll keep an eye out on eBay for a deal on a tapping head so I can try 
        one some time.</p>

      <p align="left">What the heck is a Veeblefetzer, you ask? I dunno, but it 
        looks to me like an ideal component to use in making a shaper attachment 
        for my lathe. I've been wanting a shaper attachment ever since going through 
        the painful process of trying to use the rack to move the cross slide 
        back and forth manually as a shaper. I actually don't really object to 
        the manual aspect so much, but a real shaper attachment would make the 
        process so much quicker and easier. Add it to my list of projects I'll 
        get to &quot;someday&quot;.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Flood Coolant Musings and Tips</p>
      <p> Been running across some interesting new ways of looking at things lately. 
        For example, I was sniffing around this morning trying to learn more about 
        flood cooling. It seems clear everyone feels it's the best way to go, 
        especially with CNC, but at the same time it is difficult to set it up 
        and potentially messy. I have to build a drip pan and enclosure for my 
        mill, make sure step motors are protected if I CNC, yada, yada. My understanding 
        was that it mostly lets you cut faster and the cutters will last longer 
        (one fellow said it tripled his cutter life and doubled the cutting speeds). 
        In addition, it's useful for clearing the chips on CNC since you don't 
        want to get in there with a chip brush while the cutting head is flying 
        around unpredictably at 100 inches per minute! What I read today is that 
        they also improve accuracy. The reason is obvious if you think about it, 
        if the workpiece or tool changes temperature too much the thermal expansion 
        is going to affect the cut. Here again, I think this is probably more 
        important for CNC because your initial touch off is going to set your 
        accuracy whereas a manual machinist is probably going to check the cut 
        a few times along the way. At least I do! Another fella mentions that 
        all the wet down from flood cooling keeps the chips from travelling so 
        far, which makes them easier to manage and clean up. Along the way, I 
        picked up some other handy tips too:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Put a big magnet in a plastic bag and drop it in the coolant tank 
          near the pump. It'll attract the chips away. Pull it out and clean it 
          once a week.</li>
        <li>If you're getting too much pressure from the pump, don't restrict 
          it (bad for the pump), instead put a recirc line near the pump outlet 
          that let's you divert some of the flow back to the reservoir.</li>
        <li>Make sure there is enough coolant in the reservoir to cover your pump 
          if you're using a submersible aquarium or pond pump. This will cool 
          them better and prolong their life.</li>
        <li>Find a plastic food stuff barrel (I think they're 35 gallon) and set 
          it up as a central reservoir for a couple machines sitting near each 
          other. Not too sure about this idea for a home machinist. Most coolant 
          eventually goes bad so you don't want to mix up too much more than what 
          you really need.</li>
        <li>To keep your coolant from going rancid (called &quot;skunking&quot; 
          because of the smell), you need to get the tramp oils out of it. A gadget 
          called a skimmer is used for the purpose. They look easy to make. Just 
          an inch wide belt that runs down into the coolant with a scraper at 
          top. Reminds me a little of protein skimmers used for salt water aquariums.</li>
        <li>One fellow recommends corn oil and water to cut aluminum. Another 
          likes Rustlick 307R for an all-purpose milling machine coolant.</li>
      </ul>

      <p> I've been remiss in my blogging, so I have a lot of catching up to do 
        here. Bear with me, as this may be a long passage today.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Thing of Beauty: Tree 325 Milling Machine</p>
      <p>In the Department of Someday I Want One, I firmly place the Tree 325 
        milling machine. Many fine authorities swear this machine is way better 
        than the average Bridgeport in terms of precision or rigidity, and you 
        can tell with one look that there's plenty of beef there to back that 
        up:</p>

        to $10,000 range depending on what condition they are in. A sweet deal 
        would be to find one that's mechanically sound but with a blown controller. 
        Switch that bad boy over to a PC-based control running Mach and you would 
        be in bidness!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">High Speed Machining With An Air Spindle</p>
      <p align="left">High Speed Machining: This is a big buzzword these days. 
        It focuses on higher spindle speeds. To after aluminum you need well over 
        10K. Most spindles in machines I can get my hands on won't touch that. 
        How about a nice retrofit air spindle that is removable? Check it out:</p>

        They have another model that mounts to the spindle directly rather than 
        being in a toolholder like this. Slick!</p>
      <p><b class="BlogTitle">Laser Measurement and Metrology</b></p>
      <p>I became really intrigued with the precision of lasers and their application 
        to metalworking after reading a link about using a simple laser level 
        to measure flatness of a surface with an accuracy of 0.0001&quot;! This 
        led me to create a <a href="MTLaserMetrology.htm">page to capture the 
        technique</a>. By the way, there is a whole <a href="MTLayout.htm">home 
        page for layout and measurement</a>, if you weren't aware. Check the <a href="MTLaserMetrology.htm">laser 
        metrology page</a> for more details on this fertile area. I did some research, 
        but it is far from complete.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Rail Mounting Precision for CNC Plasma and Router Tables</p>
      <p>The reason for the laser measurement thoughts mentioned above is my planning 
        for a <a href="CCPlasmaCNCHome.htm">CNC plasma/router table</a>. This 
        table will be built using linear slides. You have to mount the slides 
        on a flat surface as they are not strong enough to avoid flexing if mounted 
        to something not so flat. In fact, they are typically designed to be mounted 
        on a surface that has been milled or ground flat both under the rail, 
        and along a ridge that one side of the rail butts up to. There are a number 
        of threads and thoughts on how to go about creating such a flat surface 
        of sufficient size for one of these large machines. One 
        such advocates using a grinder and precision level and claims an accuracy 
        of 0.001&quot; in a day's work. <a href="http://oneoceankayaks.com/madvac/madvac_index.htm#Indexanch">Another 
        uses a moglice-style approach</a> wherein metal impregnated expoxy is 
        used to create a flat surface on which to mount linear rails. The resultant 
        Madvac Kayak Router is a very impressive piece of work. <a href="http://cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11024">Here 
        is the CNCZone thread on the Madvac</a> as well, FWIW. There is a <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19418&amp;highlight=alignment">lengthy 
        thread on CNCZone</a> that covers this approach in good detail as well, 
        though it was for a work-in-progress as I write this. Lastly,  Bosch 
        Rexroth has an article that provides a pretty detailed introduction to how to mount 
        linear slides, but the link keeps moving, so I have given up offering it.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/PlasmaTable/LinearRailMounting.jpg" width="640" height="302"></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>Linear slides want a flat surface and an &quot;edge&quot; 
        to keep them properly aligned...</i></b></p>
      <p>After studying all of this material, I have so far concluded that my 
        Y and Z axes pose little problem. I have purchased a commercial Z-axis 
        from eBay that I believe will serve very well. I have a piece of 3/4&quot; 
        thick aluminum that I will machine for the gantry cross piece. I would 
        expect it to be rigid and relatively light. I intend to use my Industrial 
        Hobbies mill to create the kind of rail mounting surface (i.e. with a 
        flat bottom and an &quot;edge&quot; along one side of the rail) used on 
        commercial machines. That just leaves my X-Axis which is more challenging. 
        The current plan is to build it out of a framework of 4&quot; square tubing 
        with 1/4&quot; walls. In this case I'm wondering if a couple of suitable 
        pieces of thick aluminum can be machined and then bolted to the surface 
        of the square tubing with suitable shims to avoid stressing it too much. 
        The rail would then bolt to that piece. More thought is needed!</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle"> Acoustic Chatter Recognition </p>
      <p>This is an intriguing technology that measures the natural resonant frequency 
        of your machine and workpiece in order to predict the optimal spindle 
        speed to run at with minimum chatter. Ingersoll makes a product called 
        &quot;Harmonizer&quot; that is dead simple. It's a microphone connected 
        to a laptop computer that then runs some Windows software. The software 
        basically produces a graph showing you the stable zones of spindle speed 
        where chatter should be minimized. Very cool! Now imagine Mach V (I know, 
        it doesn't exist and isn't being talked about). It drives the motors using 
        a GRex, so there is plenty of PC bandwidth available. There's a new function 
        that let's you turn on &quot;Acoustic Chatter Suppression&quot;. This 
        feature requires a microphone input to the PC so it can listen for the 
        chatter frequency. It will then automatically select the optimal spindle 
        speed to minimize chatter. Now that would be an amazing development!</p>

      <p><b class="BlogTitle">Cross Slide Drive for CNC Lathe Conversion &amp; 
        Circle Machine Boring Bar</b></p>
      <p> A bit more progress made over the weekend. I remade the shaft adapter 
        for the cross slide axis over the weekend. It wasn't a hard project. It's 
        purpose is to screw down onto the end of the current shaft and provide 
        a convenient smaller shaft for the helical beam coupler to grab onto. 
        There were a couple of annoying bits. First, as I mentioned in my 4/2 
        post, I had managed to break a boring bar and chip a drill bit trying 
        to increase the bore on the coupler. They're made of a hardened spring 
        steel and are quite tough. The solution was a Circle Machine boring bar 
        I got off eBay. These are beautiful little tools:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CircleBoringBar.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>Circle Machine Boring Bar via eBay: Sweet!</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">New, they can be quite expensive, but they are sometimes 
        available on eBay. I got lucky! The best news is that there was absolutely 
        no trouble using this bar to cut into the coupler at all. It went very 
        smoothly and without a hiccup. There is something to be said for high 
        quality tools when faced with difficult situations. It was like an entirely 
        different lathe, and I'm sure had I not broken the bar I would've blamed 
        any problems with chatter on lathe rigidity. Note that this isn't even 
        the solid carbide bar, which is even more rigid! But I digress.</p>
      <p align="left">I got the new coupler-adapter made pretty quickly. I wanted 
        to improve it in several ways. The first one I made required spacers, 
        so I made this one longer. I also wanted a little thicker shaft into the 
        coupler for strength. Lastly, I needed to cut a keyway so that the motorized 
        back and forth wouldn't work the screw loose that holds the coupler-adapter 
        in place. This last, making a keyway, was painful! I basically used an 
        HSS-Cobalt tool I had ground in the lathe's QCTP and racked back and forth 
        simulating a mini-shaper. It was a painful and imprecise operation at 
        best. The last little bit had to be cut using the HSS tool and a ball 
        peen hammer chisel style. I can definitely see why folks like having a 
        shaper around. This was a blind hole and would've been painful with an 
        arbor press and broach set. It also opened my eyes to the thought that 
        a shaper specially intended for cutting keyways and of much smaller capacity 
        would not be a bad thing. Of course I'm not the only one with this idea!</p>

      <p align="left">My next step on the lathe front is pretty simple. I need

        together, and hopefully will be able to consider the cross-slide done.

      <p align="center"><a href="http://www.homeshopmachinist.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=18787"><b><i>Rotary 
        Table Stepper Conversion</i></b></a></p>
      <p align="left">There are a couple of features to the design I really like. 
        Firstly, note how the shaft adapter is actually a machined part of the 
        Oldham-style coupler. Why hook a coupler up twice? Much better design 
        than what I'm doing on my lathe. I'll have to convert once I get my mill 
        going and can machine that tab. The second is the stepper mounting bracket. 
        The tophat-shaped cylinder has a flange on it. The square flange has a 
        milled recess that catches on the round part's flange. Now, when we bolt 
        on the stepper, it is basically a matter of sandwiching the cylinder's 
        flange between the stepper and the square flange. This let's the motor 
        be rotated to any orientation and is a very simple piece to manufacture.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">eBay Linear Slides</p>
      <p> I received a pair of HSR25 linear slides today from an eBay win. What 
        beasts these things are! They are big solid rails and heavy trucks, 2 
        trucks to a rail. I bought them to use in creating a plasma/router table. 
        They're not quite 50 inches long. Looking at them, I almost hate to &quot;waste&quot; 
        them on such a project. They'd make a fine mill or lathe axis. OTOH, they 
        didn't cost me very much. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">ESAB Plasma Cutter</p>
      <p>BTW, speaking of plasma tables, I got my big ESAB plasma cutter running 
        this last weekend:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/Welding/P4023155.JPG" width="800" height="744"> 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><b><i>My brother cuts with hot plasma...</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">That ESAB Powercut 1500 cuts likes dream! So does the De 
        Walt Multicutter cold saw sitting in the background. Anyway, the thing 
        we both noticed is that this cutter has so much power, you can hardly 
        move it along fast enough manually. Hence the need for a plasma table. 
        The other idea that struck (where am I going to put a plasma table?), 
        was to build a welding shop on top of the car lift you see in the picture. 
        It's the only way I've got room for it at present, and I am not using 
        the lift much for cars. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Put a Welding Shop on a Car Lift</p>
      <p align="left">The idea would lay out something like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/Welding/WeldingLift.jpg" width="800" height="633"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/Welding/WeldingLift2.jpg" width="600" height="507"></p>
      <p align="left">As you can see, there would be room for a decent sized 1/2&quot; 
        plate welding table, the 2 welders and plasma cutter, a smallish plasma 
        table (4 feet x 4 feet), and a spot to put the DeWalt saw with room to 
        saw pretty long stock. When not in use, push a button and the hole thing 
        goes up into the ceiling and out of the way. I can park a car under it 
        with ease. The idea has potential!</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Broken Boring Bar</p>
      <p>Was continuing to refine my cross slide CNC adapter and managed to break 
        a boring bar. I was trying to enlarge the hole in a helical beam coupler. 
        The operation had worked fine on the leadscrew side but did not go well 
        on the cross slide. I chipped a drill bit and then snapped the head right 
        off my boring bar. Doh! A new bar is on order, but I can't get much further 
        without it.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Lost Wax Casting Steam Engine Parts</p>
      <p>I was purusing a new discussion board and came across an interesting 
        article on lost wax casting for a <a href="http://www.chaski.org/homemachinist/viewtopic.php?t=73433">scale 
        steam engine project</a>. Wow! This guys parts really come out looking 
        nice. He's using a CNC to machine acrylic which is then used as a wax 
        mold for the casting process. Here are some photos:</p>
