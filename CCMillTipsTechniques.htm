      <p class="BodyText"><i>Once you've got the <a href="CCMillTramming.html">mill trammed</a>, your next step is very likely going 
        to be putting a vise onto the table.</i>  Here's how various folks on the web have reported tramming their vises:</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-----------</p>
      <p class="BodyText"><i>Does the vise attach by bolts into the T slots of the table? if so, 
        then you have a simple way to check square, you need a dial indicator, 
        an indi-col device, and then put the indicator into the indicol's small 
        end, and put the large end onto the spindle, and run the table's X axis. 
        the amount of change or angle on the indicator will tell you which way 
        the vise need to be adjusted its a long process but you will get it </i></p>
      <p><i>-----------</i></p>
      <p><i>Mount an indicator in a drill chuck, bearing on the fixed jaw of the 
        vise. Traverse the table (X axis) back and forth, and adjust the vise 
        position until you get the same reading at both ends of the fixed jaw. 
        Given that you have a swivel base, there's a shortcut to get you close: 
        Take a reading at the center of the jaw, then at one end. Calculate the 
        difference between the two readings. With the indicator still at the end 
        position, rotate the vise to remove HALF of the difference. Several cautions: 
        1) Make sure the indicator arm is actually moving. I've seen people do 
        this with the arm hard against the stop, and think they have the vise 
        adjusted perfectly 2) If the jaw is mounted with two screws, take a reading 
        directly above each mounting screw and use these to determine whether 
        the vise is square. The pressure of the mounting screws can distort the 
        jaw. If the jaw was ever mounted with any dirt or contamination underneath, 
        it can be permanently distorted, even if the obstruction was later removed. 
        3) Make sure the fixed jaw is straight in the first place. As noted above, 
        it can be bent by the pressure of the mounting screws. This may be a bigger 
        challenge than squaring the vise on the mill. </i></p>
      <p><i>-----------</i></p>
      <p><i>Quick and dirty... clamp a dowel or other piece of bar stock in the 
        spindle. Tighten one side of the vise pretty well and leave the other 
        just barely snug. Just make contact with dowel on the face of the fixed 
        jaw at the tight end of the vise. Move loose end to where it is definitely 
        a bit out of line. Crank table under spindle with dowel in contact with 
        the fixed jaw. When you have gone the entire length of the jaw, come back 
        and make one more pass for insurance. NOW break out your DI and tweak 
        it if you don't like what you see. I did this today for a quick setup. 
        When I put the DI in to check, I had less than .0005 in 4" on the vise 
        jaws. Close enough for what I was doing by far. Same deal with a horizontal, 
        but grab a fairly large diam slotting cutter very lightly with the vise. 
        Tighten the bolts. Put a DI on it now. If the vise jaws need to be parallel 
        to the arbor, you might be able to come up enough to grab the arbor the 
        same way. If not, do it the hard way. </i></p>
      <p><i>----------</i></p>
      <p><i>To get the fixed jaw close, I'll use either a drill bit or a dowel 
        pin in a drill chuck. Set a gap by eye at one end, duplicate it as best 
        as possible at the other end. Once you get it where you can barely tell 
        the difference by eye it's time for the indicator. Saves being way off 
        and having the test indicator needle spinning wildly and forgetting which 
        way is which. </i></p>
      <p><i>-----------</i></p>
      <p><i>Some vises move only a tiny amount from loose to tight - my Kurt changes 
        less than .010, with the table bolts pulled forward. Others move at least 
        one time zone. With those, as Bob said, snugging the bolts and making 
        final adjustments with a hammer is the easiest way. An 8 oz ball-pein 
        is a good size, small enough that you won't damage the vise. If you vise 
        is newer, or has newer jaw plates, indicate directly from the fixed jaw. 
        If the jaws are well used & look like the surface of the moon, a tall 
        parallel (clamped in the vise) gives the indicator a nice surface to contact. 
        </i></p>
      <p><i>-----------</i></p>
      <p><i>Last but not least, in Secrets of a Machine Shop, the author mentions 
        that you can eyeball to within 0.002&quot; by putting a piece of long 
        stock in the vise such that you can eyeball the visual gap between the 
        stock and the table's edge. This assumes that edge is actually parallel 
        to the table's motion--something to be checked on an Asian import!</i></p>
      <p><i>You could also use a steel rule. One fellow starts out with the rule 
        in the vise, eyeballing the gap. He claims his accuracy with the rule 
        is 0.010&quot;, which is a good place to start with an indicator.</i></p>

        Coaxial Indicator from Shars and after trying it out decided, &quot;Man, 
        what a cool gadget!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here it is in action as I center 
        the spindle over a hole so I can use my boring head to make a shoulder 
        on the hole:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/ZAxisMod/P1010262.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picture that long 
        feeler as being sort of like a very exagerated finger from a dial test 
        indicator. It goes against the inside of the hole, or there are curved 
        feelers for the outside of a round boss. You turn on the spindle at the 
        lowest rpm, say 100rpm, and hold the horizontal rod. This keeps the indicator 
        facing your way while the feeler sweeps around the circumference of the 
        feature you want to center on. As the feeler sweeps around, the needle 
        will "kick" because the spindle axis is not centered. Now adjust the X 
        and Y axis handwheels until the needle kicks as little as possible. That's 
        all there is to it, you are done very quickly. What a nice gadget!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adjust the axes 
        one at a time and don't even think much about what's needed. Simply turn

        the direction that kicks less. When you've minimized the kick on one axis, 
        do the other. I circle back a second time around and got to almost no

      <p><i>Make sure your mill is trammed in properly before attempting any accuracy 
        drilling or boring!</i></p>
      <p><i>Couple of suggestions... </i></p>
      <p><i>-use vee-jaws for a better grip on the part (4points of contact instead 
        of 2) </i></p>
      <p><i>-use a 120 deg spotting drill rather than the center drill...cups 
        the drill point better IMHO and just as rigid </i></p>
      <p><i>-lock table & saddle gibs as suggested...noting any change in the 
        DRO readings and compensating appropriately. </i></p>
      <p><i>On the center drill, if you use one, and I understand why, they are 
        short, rigid, and common in the shop, so only use it to SPOT, then it 
        is a 118 degree spotter, all is good, don't drill deeper than the drill 
        point, and surely don't drill deep enough to actually start to get a center. 
        I elarned how bad this is for the following drill in harder materials, 
        the tips of the flutes start cutting first and get chipped, it cannot 
        be good for the drill in softer material either is my thinking.</i></p>
      <p><i> It comes to mind your mill may have some &quot;lost motion&quot; 
        somewhere, so with a good indicator you can dial in, and come back to 
        0 on the DRO from differant directions and see what ends up happening. 
        Also I have never seen this, BUT your quill travel may not be square to 
        the spindle bearings, I cannot imagine how that could happen on a good 
        machine, but you can check for it.</i></p>
      <p><i>It sounds to me like you are getting a reasonable result for drilled 
        holes. Use a new centre drill and a new, good quality, drill. Make sure 
        you ease the centre drill in, using high revs, cutting oil and clear often. 
        Same with the drill, slow down to correct speed, cutting oil, clear often. 
        Don't use re-sharpened drills on a job like this, keep yourself a good 
        set for jobs like this. I disagree with the idea of only dimpling with 
        a centre drill. Make a decent centre in my experience. Maybe you need 
        to start thinking about boring your holes if you want exact locations, 
        but this will slow you down a lot, single point cutting is a another (harder) 
        skill to learn! </i></p>
      <p><i>As to making a "good center" with the center drill, trying that in 
        some 4140 HT or even harder stuff will illustrate the condition that learned 
        me to NOT do that, actually a 120 degree spotting drill is better anyway 
        but not as commonly avail within arms reach in the shop. if a hard material 
        chips off the drill tips when running a 118 drill into a 60 degree center, 
        I have to think the same process occurs with softer material, but is not 
        as apparent because it is not as extreme. If you watch, feel, and listen 
        to a drill you can tell it is unhappy when starting (sounds japanese eh) 
        but it gets very happy when fully engaged and doing the job it was made 
        to do, a 120 spotter gets it to the happy place quicker :-) I agree "spark 
        out" of the drill with the quill against the depth stop (or a short G04 
        in cnc)helps get a better location, it gives any spring in the machine 
        and setup a chance to work itself out. I never want to seem to cut down 
        anothers experience, their method may sure add quality to MY work if I 
        apply it, and I think the key is finding the WHY in the process that makes 
        great parts, sometimes it is not truly a result of the intent of the guy 
        that found it but it cannot be denied that it works. I also wanted to 
        add that adding a "boring" step to the process with an endmill in a collet 
        can truly make for better positions, honestly if the endmill is only taking 
        out a little per side it may be truly as accurate as single point boring, 
        and a following drill or reamer will follow very close to that established 
        position. The drill generally "wants" to go straight and starting it off 
        that way helps it do that...they can and do wander as depth increases, 
        but if they are started off position they cannot help but walk like mad.</i></p>
      <p><i><b>Dealing with Runout, Especially When Reaming</b></i></p>
      <p><i>If you have runout, consider the following. If you have an ER collet 
        you can tap the tool in. Measure, find the high spot and keep taping it 
        until it gets runs true. Works with collet holders but not usually EM 
        holders. We do it at work all the time seeing as harldy any of our machines 
        run true. They all need new spindles as far as runout is concerned. Good 
        tapers, bad bearings, usually. one of our machines runs dead nuts untill 
        you clamp a tool in the spindle and put tension on the bearings... Then 
        it is out .0015 at 6 inches from the face, which with PCD Reamers is not 
        acceptable.</i></p>
      <p><i>Here we go again guys. From the men at Spindle Grinding Service.....Check 
        the taper. Not only for runout, but use some Dykem 107 high spot blue 
        on the holder and clamp it in to check contact. If the taper is worn it 
        will cause runout in your holder. That would be my very first check. Something 
        tells me that is the problem. Could possibly be drawbar pressure, but 
        the taper would be my first guess. </i></p>
      <p><i><b>Precision Reaming Dowel Holes</b></i></p>
      <p><i>Whenever we get an oversized dowel pin hole we get out the ball bearings. 
        Stick one in the offending hole and give it a tap with a hammer. Now the 
        pin will hold securely, and as long as the hole location was correct before 
        it should work for you now. I've had to do this more times than I care 
        to recall. Now this is for in-house tooling. I don't think I could sell 
        this to anyone if they saw me doing it. With the pin in it though, you 
        can't even tell. Also, with reamers the top portion of the shank is annealed, 
        and will "float" into the hole without boring it. If you hold it below 
        the anneal you will end up with a very inaccurate boring bar.</i></p>
      <p><i>The ball bearing idea is a good one, but not for pallets that my customer 
        needs to work with. In house though this is an excellent idea. Any thoughts 
        on diameter of ball to hole? 2X? 3X? I only ask because too small a ball 
        would put a lot of force radially outward and too large a ball would put 
        a lot of force axially downward. I need to think about this some...</i></p>
      <p><i>We do a lot of dowel pin holes, up to 1/2". We have had good luck 
        by spot drilling, drilling about .030" undersize, boring with a 2 flute 
        end mill that is .015" under, & then reaming. The endmill is chamfered 
        about .030" x 45 deg, & most of the flutes are ground off, leaving about 
        1/8" of full diameter at the front. We use from .006" to .012" IPR feed. 
        Using the endmill gives a quick & dirty way to get true position & the 
        reamer will follow the hole. This process is not as good as boring for 
        true position but is pretty close & a lot faster. Sometimes to repair 
        a loose dowel hole, I will tap it with the same size form tap, i.e. 1/4-20 
        form tap for a 1/4" dowel. The tap will raise ridges to tighten the hole 
        and with a little loctite, I am done. We also made an alignment block, 
        just like a tapping block, with about .002" clearance for the dowels. 
        It makes dowel installation easy. </i></p>

        are having a hard time getting things cutting nicely, why not try a little 
        coolant? If you are using carbide, be careful not to drench the coolant

      <p><b><font size="+1">How to make a <a href="http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/0502bp1.html">fog 
        buster</a></font></b></p>
      <p>The fog buster is a coolant option many recommend, particularly those 
        that don't want to deal with the mess of flood cooling and are afraid 
        of the health issues associated with coolant mists (bad for the lungs). 
        A fog buster delivers a stream of coolant embedded in an air stream without 
        converting the coolant to an aerosol mist. The end result is the coolant 
        winds up on the workpiece and not in the air:</p>
      <p>The Fog Buster works this way with a single needle valve serving as a 
        mixture control. Since the Coolant and air are pressurized equally, and 
        the air is the mainline, the single needle valve acts as a mixture control 
        to limit the amount of coolant added to a fixed amount of air. The net 
        effect is that with a single needle valve you can dial all the way from 
        a near flood coolant to pure air. If you search the message archives, 
        Mike Hanz posted some great pictures and a parts list for a homemade Fog 
        Buster back in 2003. He used a precision "panel" needle valve from McMaster, 
        part number 48965K24. This needle valve counter-sinks into the brass block, 
        so you get a neat, compact package without the valves hanging off the 
        ends. Mike also turned me on to the water filter canister, part number 
        4422K3, for the coolant reservoir. This is the same tank the commercial 
        Fog Buster unit uses. </p>
      <p>I think that were I seeking a coolant option somewhere between a chip 
        brush and flood cooling, and more than just an air stream, the fog buster 
        would be ideal. I'm not sure it is worth the trouble to make versus buy, 
        but it isn't a very hard project either.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Accurate Z-Axis Adjustment on the Mill (aka I love 
        it when a gadget actually works!) </p>
      <p class="style1">In working on the <a href="CCTurnersCube.html">Turner's 
        Cube</a>, being able to determine Z-axis precisely is imperative. In addition, 
        I am still having a hard time achieving the level of accuracy I routinely 
        get on my lathe over on my mill. On the lathe, getting it accurate to 
        a thousandth is never a problem, and even if I am not paying much attenting, 
        things come within 3 or 4 thousandths. I haven't spent much time fiddling 
        with tenths yet, but someday I will. On the mill, I seem to be doing good 
        if I hit the high single digit thousandths, say accurate to 7 or 8 thousandths. 
        I know its my technique, and its just not good enough. </p>
      <p class="style1">I mention somewhere below that one has to allocate time 
        to experimentation, so tonight I resolved to experiment with z-axis accuracy, 
        and along the way, dug out a purchase I had almost forgotten to test for 
        the purpose. In the end, I tried four different methods. In each case 
        I used my granite surface plate and digital height gage to determine how 
        closely I had come.</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/TurnersCubes/P1213709.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Using the granite surface plate 
        and height gage to determine z-axis positioning accuracy... </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">To use the height gage, I zero it on the 1-2-3 block and 
        then add 1&quot; to the reading off the top of my aluminum cube. On the 
        mill, I used each of 4 methods to find the top of the block, zeroed my 
        <a href="MTMillDRO.htm">quill DRO</a>, dialed in a desired depth of cut 
        with the fine quill adjustment, made the cut under <a href="CCMillPowerFeed.html">power 
        feed,</a> and then checked how close I came to the expected result. Incidentally, 
        the process of finding the top of the workpiece (or side on a lathe) is 
        called a &quot;touch off.&quot; </p>
      <p class="style1">Here are the results of each z-axis setting method:</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>Touch off by feel</strong>: For my 1st Method, 
        with the spindle stopped, clunk down the cutter onto the top of the workpiece. 
        Zero the DRO and go from there. This produced a result with an error of 
        0.012&quot;. Not very good! The error was relatively repeatable, so one 
        could add the fudge factor. In the end of the day, the cut was 0.012&quot; 
        deeper than desired.</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>Touch off by sound</strong>: For my 2nd try, I 
        was gently lower the spindle under power and listen for when the cutter 
        started to cut. This method proved slightly more accuate, and resulted 
        in 0.0085&quot; too deep a cut. Still not very good.</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>Touch off with paper</strong>: The traditional 
        old school method involves holding a piece of cigarette paper (rumored 
        to be exactly 0.001&quot; thick) on the workpiece and gradually lowering 
        the cutter until it starts to catch the paper. Add another 0.001&quot; 
        and you are at zero! Not having any cigarette papers, I used standard 
        laser printer paper. I cut a 1/2&quot; wide strip so I could hold onto 
        one end from a safe distance, and waited for the cutter to grab. In my 
        case, I got a grab at 0.010&quot;, not 0.001&quot;, but at least it was 
        a nice round number and pretty repeatable.</p>
      <p class="style1"><strong>Z-axis Presetter</strong>: At this point, I thought 
        I was done and would be using the good old paper trick. But I had a vague 
        recollection that finally came back to me. Did you ever by a gadget that 
        looked like a good idea, but before it ever arrived you started doubting 
        it would work well, stuck it up on a shelf, and never actually tried it? 
        I do that way too often. In this case, thing I remembered was a Z-axis 
        Presetter I bought off eBay around 8 months ago. Search for &quot;Z Axis 
        Presetter&quot; on eBay, and you'll find the ubiquitous 800watt listed 
        Chinese machine tool gadget. They look like this:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/ZAxisPresetter.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>A Z-axis Presetter from eBay seller 
        800watt...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I have a dim recollection of some CNC guys 
        recommending one of these to use with CNC machines. How does it work? 
        Simple. There is a little knurled knob visible on the bottom left. It 
        has a &quot;test&quot; and a &quot;use&quot; position. Set it to &quot;test&quot; 
        and an internal standard swings into place so that if you press the anvil 
        on top with your finger until you hit the stop, you'll have exactly 2&quot; 
        from top of anvil to bottom of gadget. You rotate the dial to zero in 
        that position. Now reset the knob to &quot;use&quot;, place it atop the 
        workpiece, bring the cutter down until the needle registers, zero the 
        needle, zero your DRO, and you should be exactly 2&quot; above whatever 
        the presetter is sitting on. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">So, not expecting much, I plunked the sucker 
        down atop my aluminum cube in my Kurt vise on the mill, cranked the head 
        until the cutter almost touched. Locked the head and cranked the quill 
        with the fine adjust until the needle zeroed, zeroed my DRO, removed the 
        presetter, cranked down another 2&quot; with the fine adjust, zeroed the 
        DRO again, added 0.010&quot; for a modest cut, ran the cube through under 
        power feed, and hauled the block over to the surface plate to see what 
        I had done.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The desired result was 2.396&quot;. I brought 
        the height gage down to take a reading which was, drumroll please, 2.396&quot;!!!!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Holy uncanny accuracy, Batman! The silly 
        presetter actually worked, and it worked well, and even though the quill 
        travelled 2&quot;, and I expected the worst, it came out deadly accurate!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Hooray for the gadget that actually worked. 
        I guess I'll be using the silly thing more often. At $39, it was worth 
        it!</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Playing With Blocks (2-4-6 Blocks, That Is) </p>

        is showing how he has done something. Here is the Fidgiting Widgitmaster 
        showing how he squared a 6&quot; x 6&quot; plate in his vise using 2-4-6

      <p class="style1"><strong>Flycutters</strong></p>
      <p class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A fly cutter will often produce 
        the best surface finish because they allow you to finish a very wide area 
        in one pass with no overlap marks. They make a distinctive sound as their single cutting edge 
        makes its cut on the workpiece. It's a noise that drives some machinist's 
        crazy and can best be characterized as a loud thumping (often called &quot;hammering&quot;) that sounds like 
        its about to tear itself apart. </font>You can easily convert a facemill to a flycutter by removing all but one insert, and it is interesting to experiment with the results.  Reducing the number of inserts will necessitate a reduction in feedrate, but it may be worth it in terms of improved surface finish.</p>
      <p class="style1"><a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/cnc-machining/how-get-best-mirror-machined-flat-finish-6061-aluminum-188221/">Some people swear</a> that the best finish for aluminum is a flycutter large enough to cut your material in a single pass equipped with a PCD insert of the largest possible radius. </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like most mill cutters, 
        your fly cutter will perform better with positive rake on the cutting 
        tool. I haven't yet seen any positive rake brazed carbide tools (which seem like the most common thing people stick in their flycutters), so I 
        suppose you would either need an insert like a CCMT or you'd need to grind 
        your own tool from HSS with some positive rake. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someday I want 
        to build an R8 fly cutter that has a built in CCMT insert. I'll use a 
        design similar to <a href="MTMillDovetail.htm">my dovetail cutter</a>, 
        and I don't think it would be a hard tool to make.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a sample 
        of the surface finish possible with a fly cutter and off-the-shelf brazed carbide lathe tool:</font></p>

      <p align="center" class="style1">Not bad, not great finish...</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was one of 
        my first cuts with the tool, I was squaring a block for my <a href="MTMillKurtViseStop.htm">vise stop project</a>. 
        I didn't run the spindle nearly as fast as I should have for a great finish, 
        but it still came out pretty decently. The moral of the story is that 
        fly cutters are cheap and  easy to use. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fly cutters are 
        very sensitive to tram. If you think about it, the cutter is apt to cut 
        a concave instead of flat cut if your mill's head is not trammed properly. 
        Watch your workpiece carefully as the leading edge moves through the center 
        of the fly cutter. All the cutting should have been done as it was travelling 
        the first half of the way if you head is in tram (think about it carefull, 
        that's one geometry for one direction, so you actually have to see this 
        behavior cutting in both directions to be sure). If it cuts more on the 
        second half, you can be sure the tram is such that the head has that half 
        tilted downward slightly. You can see the tramming effects in this photowhich has had the cuts accentuated via some Photoshop tricks:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mill head 
        is close to being in tram, but you can see that one set of marks is a 
        little heavier than the others. If you're really out of tram, you can 
        only see one set of marks. Also, the larger the fly cutter diameter, the 
        more the tram effect is exaggerated.</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle"><b>Miscellaneous Tips and Techniques</b></p>
      <p><i>A note about gibbs. On column mills, the gibbs affect the tram of 
        the head. If you like to tighten or lock them every time you perform an 
        operation, you will limit the accuracy of your head tram. Better to adjust 
        them fairly tight perhaps 4 times a year, tram after the adjustment, and 
        then leave the gibbs alone if best accuracy is desired.</i></p>
      <p><i>Tramming your mill to a &quot;thou or two&quot; may not be good enough. 
        If you move your table to a different spot to drill than where you indicated 
        your part at you get projected error. also, try a test indicator in an 
        indicol rather than your co-ax it will tell you if your co-ax is cheesy 
        or not. I recommend Interapid.</i></p>
      <p><i>Use a singlepoint test indicator...the coax relies on a mechanism 
        and precision alignments and fits therein. I am a fan of Interapid's offerings 
        in that category.</i></p>
      <p><i>Do yourself a favor, spoil yourself and buy an interrapid incicator, 
        I bought a .0005 and aquired a .0001 over 20 years ago, the .005 has been 
        repaired once, otherwise they have served me faithfully ever since, their 
        only downside most of us machinests never see is they are effected by 
        strong magnets, so guys that only grind don't use them...turning on a 
        6&quot; permag chuck will damp .0003 tir out of an interrapid...didnt 
        belive it until I was shown it by a man with far more experience ID grinding 
        than me.</i></p>
      <p><i>Other than that hands down they are the nicest deal going, a guy turned 
        me onto them back in 1984, so I guess it has been 22 years...I was 19 
        then hehe, 41 now, still on that same indicator.</i></p>
      <p><i>Never move the knee after picking up location. Learn to tram head 
        dead nuts on a 6" circle. When the head is not trammed dead nuts and you 
        move the knee, the location changes. If you are out .004 on a 6" circle, 
        and you move the knee 3" after removing your co-ax, you are now off .001 
        on location. In addition to the Interapid, get an Indicol that will attach 
        to the spindle with a tool in place. This will allow you to use your indicator 
        at any time. The easier it is to use, the more often you will use it. 
        Also, get a couple of small mirrors to read the dial when its facing the 
        column. Sticking your neck around back gets old very fast. </i></p>
      <p><i>I did not think about the knee changing the position of the tram, 
        however, I was aware that the quill would throw you off, for example, 
        if you tram the head with the quill retracted, and make your cuts with 
        the quill extended several inches. It just magnifies your tram error, 
        correct?</i></p>
      <p><i>The reverse also works, if you tram your mill with the quill fully 
        extended, then the accuracy is higher when retracted. </i></p>
      <p><i>Tram your head over the largest circle you can swing (ie the width 
        of the table). Use a dial or finger indicator and read directly on the 
        table surface. No blocks, rings or anything else required, all will introduce 
        error. Personally I tram the head without locking the knee, because I 
        almost never use the knee lock at any time for the work I do. Centre you 
        workpiece with a finger type indicator of some sort, the result will be 
        right, whereas it sounds like the Coaxial type are not always trustworthy. 
        You can even use a plunger-type indicator if that is all you have, and 
        if you have enough room. The magnetic base will stick to your drill chuck 
        and away you go. Sounds clumsy (it is) but use what you have. I don't 
        take much notice of the suggestions about not moving the knee, sometimes 
        you have to. Try not to, ie plan ahead. </i></p>
      <p><i>I once had a guy working for me that had a Blake Co-ax. He scrapped 
        quite a few parts before I made him stop using it. Unless the quill is 
        in perfect tram, you are changing the center location, if you move the 
        knee up or down, after you indicate the center of the workpiece. Error 
        can be even more, if there is any wear or play in the knee gibs. </i></p>
      <p><i>One more thing to try: put a cylindrical square on the table, and 
        use an indicator to check whether the z axis is parallel to the square's 
        axis. It could easily be that your z axis ways have excessive wear and 
        its time to rebuild.</i></p>
      <p><i>It's VERY IMPORTANT to always lock the vertical travel of the knee 
        before you do anything, whether it's taking a measurement or making a 
        cut. With the knee loose, it will pull away from the column, but the magnitude 
        and direction of the movement are unpredictable. Whenever you unlock the 
        knee, its final position depends on the amount of weight on the table 
        and the location of the center of gravity. But the center of gravity changes 
        every time you move the table on either axis. You first position the Z 
        axis as required, then lock the vertical travel, then do whatever else 
        you need to do. </i></p>
      <p><i>On assuming your tram is goodt. We re-indicate the tram every morning, 
        before every fresh setup, after heavy milling, after a suspicious measurement, 
        and of course, after a crash(tho'that's never happened to me ). In mold 
        work it is imperative as you usually doing onesy work and weld is so detrimental 
        to the life of tool. After a week of indicating the whole shop in it is 
        quite second nature and takes little time.</i></p>
      <p><i> As for the rig to indicate with we always called this a &quot;tram 
        bar&quot;. I find indicol's and those silly Co-ax indicators a waste of 
        money. I made this bar by tracing off my mentor, he traced his off of 
        his mentor and who knows where the pattern started. In this part of the 
        country this type tram bar is common in many mold shops and other shops. 
        It is a simple project and was the first tool I made when I took up mold 
        making. </i></p>
      <p><i> It is simply CRS c&amp;h with an ejector pin (drill rod will work) 
        for a post, all thread for the screw, the universal sleeve is from Starrett, 
        and then a ball swivel from Starrett or B&amp;S. I welded an extension 
        to the swivel. This rig will tram all the diameters and squares you will 
        see. If needed a second snug and rod can be added to extend range. This 
        will clamp down and bite hard and not wiggle or droop (a problem with 
        the half baked Indicol with the nylon friction washers. Do yourself a 
        favor and whittle out one of these and you'll never have any issue with 
        mystery location and flyer holes. </i></p>
      <p><i>well i have to make a coment or two here. first i stone the table 
        to remove any burrs then i use a 1" gauge block under the indicator so 
        i dont worry about the indicator jarring or moving due to jumping over 
        the T-slots. second in reference to the Blake coax use. these indicators 
        are so quick to use for an initial location it amazes me anyone would 
        not want to use one. but having said that i always go back and tweek the 
        last few thou with at least a .0005" indicator but usually with a .0001" 
        indicator, after all if your within .005" or less it just takes a few 
        seconds to be dead nuts.</i></p>
