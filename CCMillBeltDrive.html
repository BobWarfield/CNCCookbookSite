      <p class="BlogTitle">Running a Three Phase VFD on Single Phase Power by Derating</p>
      <p class="BodyText"><a href="http://www.cnc-arena.com/en/forum/more-hp-pcnc--261060-2.html">Via CNCArena Tormach Forums</a></p>
      <p class="BodyText">You can use a 3 phase input VFD, and power it off of single phase. You just need to derate the VFD by a factor of 1.73 to account for only a single phase of power.<br>
        <br>
        Or to put it in more useful terms, you need to buy a more powerful VFD to accommodate your 5 HP motor, using the formula of (5 HP)* 1.73 = 8.7 HP.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        This doesn't mean you are drawing 8.7HP worth of current. The current max current draw off of 230 V single phase for this inverter is approx I=(5 HP)*(746W/HP)/(230V * 0.85 * 0.85)= 22A (last two 0.85 factors account for the inefficiency of the motor and the VFD). Powering 5 HP off a single phase 230V circuit is doable, and since the VFD is acting as a soft-starter, and limiting the starting surge, it is much less problematic than powering a 5HP cap start-run straight off the same circuit.<br>
        <br>
        <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dartcontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/De-Rating-VFD-for-Single-Phase-Power.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dartcontrols.com/wp-conte...hase-Power.pdf</a><br>
        <br>
        This is a common practice, and the VFD manufacturers usually provide instructions about doing this.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">----------------</p>
      <p class="BodyText">My newer inverter welding machine is connedted like that too, you just use the two 230 single phase leads and leave the third lead unconnected that would be used for three phase, it is derated some though.</p>

I'll leave this in here so people can find it, but I've gone back to thinking about a more traditional VFD setup.</span></p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">The rpm range is 400 - 6000 rpm.   The controller is PWM-ready, so is easily interfaced to Mach3.  There is also a charge pump/E-Stop input. The motor is a brushless DC, so it should last a good long time.   The power supply is integral so you can plug it into either 110 or 220, and there is even a nifty LCD tachometer that shows the RPM.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Judging from the video, it isn't real fast on acceleration, but it isn't terrible either--about 6 seconds to ramp the entire range from S400 to S6000.  You'll definitely want to think about using a G4 Dwell in your g-code though.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">3HP is not too bad. I had to cannibalize my 3HP VFD I had bought for the mill so I could run my big bandsaw, so I will need to be in the market for something else.    This would definitely be another setup to consider instead of a VFD + AC motor.    It'd be cool to have one with both an &quot;Aluminum&quot; and a &quot;Steel&quot; speed range.   The Steel would gear down the 400-6000 rpm range to maybe 100-1500 rpm, while the Aluminum would go the other way for a range of maybe 550-8000 rpm.    That Steel range might be too low, so a 1:2 ratio would give 200-3000 rpm. I need to play with it on <a href="FeedSpeedsCalculator/CCGWizard.html">G-Wizard</a> to see what ranges I'd favor.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">There are some issues if you read on in the CNCZone thread. Also, it appears that $229 will not buy you both the motor and controller.  Maybe not as godo a setup as it seemed. Back to sensorless vector drives for me!</p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">The idea is to use the scale with a test cell to measure the displacement of the bearing inner race when the appropriate preload is attained.  Once that has been determined, spacers can be machined that deliver the same displacement and hence the same preload.

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Mazak QT-20 lathe runs 120mm ID bearings on the spindle and has a spindle bore of 2.44&quot;.     That works out to a wall thickness of about 1.142&quot; or about 29mm.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let's say we want to build a lathe spindle with a spindle bore of 2&quot;.    Let's give it a 1&quot; wall thickness, so we need bearings with 4&quot; ID which is 101mm.

      <p align="left" class="style1">So, for example, suppose we have a pair of AC bearings arranged in a back-to-back configuration.    If we want to increase the preload we need to reduce the width of the inner race spacer.  Note that A, B, and C refer to bearing preload classes. So if we wanted to increase the preload from class A to class B, we would reduce the width of the inner spacer by amount a.  Here are the a and b amounts:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/BearingSpacerSizes.jpg" width="558" height="977"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/BearingSpacerSizes2.jpg" width="734" height="1244"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Okay, let's work an example.  Let's say I have a pair of 7207 CD bearings that I want to preload.   The minimum spacer size difference I might use is a, which is 9 micrometers.   That's 0.009 mm or 0.00035&quot;. The largest displacement I might use would be<span class="style1"> a+b = 21 micrometers = 0.00083&quot;.  Pretty small spacer size difference!</span></p>
      <p class="style1">Bear in mind that these differences are used to step of from preload class A to B or C.  Those preloads for the 7207 CD series are 60, 120, and 240N for class A, B, and C respectively.      Let's compare:</p>
      <p class="style1">- Going from A to B increases preload 60N, and requires a 0.00035&quot; spacer.</p>
      <p class="style1">- Going from B to C increases preload 120N, and requires a 0.00047&quot; spacer.</p>
      <p class="style1">- Going from A to C increases preload 180N, and requires a  0.00083&quot; spacer.</p>
      <p class="style1">We can extrapolate that to go from no-preload (i.e. we bought raw bearings that are not ground for preload) to the class C preload (i.e. 240N preload) might take something on the order of 0.00118&quot; or a tiny bit more.</p>
      <p class="style1">In terms of the spacer rings themselves, SKF had this to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="style1">The spacer rings should be made of highgrade steel that can   be hardened to between 45 and 60&nbsp;HRC, depending on the application. Particular   importance must be given to the plane parallelism of the face surfaces, where   the permissible shape deviation must not exceed 1 to 2&nbsp;&micro;m. The overall width of   the inner and outer spacer rings should be identical.</p>
        <p class="style1">The most accurate way to do this is to process the width of   the concentric inner and outer spacer rings in one operation.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="style1">Making the rings to the requisite accuracy is definitely a grinding operation since we're measuring progress in tenths.  These rings are not going to be very wide either.  Let's say not more than the width of the bearing itself.</p>
      <p class="style1">We will mount the pair of bearings on the spindle nose against a shoulder on the spindle. The inner race spacer will go between the bearings as will the outer race spacer.     A precision nut will thread onto the spindle nose and down onto the inner race of the bearing stack to hold it in place.   The nut is precision simply because it has been faced so that the surface against the bearings is flat.</p>

That's a hard task, but I'm starting to think the Hitachi SJ300 with the optional <a href="http://www.hitachi-america.us/supportingdocs/forbus/inverters/Support/NB616XB_SJ-FB_Manual.pdf">SJ-FD encoder board</a> might do the trick.

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suppose you want 
        to run a 30 taper. It has drive tangs, so you need to be able to line 
        up your spindle properly with the tangs to build an automatic tool changer. 
        Most of the commercial VMC's are using a servo to drive the spindle (even 
        if it is a fairly ordinary motor with a fancy drive). That's one approach, 
        but not cheap. Try looking for a 2 or 3 HP servo drive and motor!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another thought 
        is to use a smaller stepper that can be disengaged to index the spindle 
        for tool changes. You want to disengage it because if it's driven all 
        the time it wears out the stepper and it generates back EMF that will 
        fry the servo drive. At the least you need to electronically disengage 
        it.</font></p>

        <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=87884">another 
        way that I just saw on CNCZone</a>. NEATMan suggests using a cam action.

        we have an impact wrench style powered drawbar or an air cylinder that 
        compresses a Belleville spring stack. Either way, there is a downward 
        motion. We use that downward motion to push a roller equipped assembly 
        against the cam. The roller will then turn the spindle until the roller 
        is at its lower point, which should line up the indexing for the drive 
        tangs.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Vector Drive 
        Magic </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been keeping 
        an eye on vector drives for a little while now. Essentially, they are 
        a &quot;better VFD&quot; to drive an AC motor with variable speed. Why 
        better? Because they enable a wider speed range without loss of torque. 
        I read a <a href="http://www.reliance.com/pdf/drives/whitepapers/D7161.pdf">white 
        paper by Reliance Electric</a> that indicated you could expect a 2:1 range 
        for a regular VFD, and a 4:1 range with a vector drive. In other words, 
        run your motor at up to half speed without losing torque with a normal 
        VFD, and 1/4 speed with a vector drive. Why does this matter? Because 
        the speed range you need to cover the gamut of machining tough steels 
        all the way up to aluminum and soft materials is huge. To span a range 
        of 100 rpm all the way to 8000 rpm (still nowhere close to what a lot 
        of CNC's run today) takes an 80:1 range!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's why you 
        need gear changes, back gears, step pulleys, variable pitch pulleys, or 
        a host of other mechanical transmissions used on different machine tools. 
        But those transmissions are a hassle to deal with too, especially if you 
        want to build your own machine, or <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">radically 
        alter the performance envelope of you spindle</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it was with 
        some interest that I came across a <a href="http://www.smcyclo.com/products/ac/hf430.shtml">Sumitomo 
        Vector Drive spec</a>. I guess a good vector drive these days has more 
        range than Reliance gives them credit for. A sensorless drive is one you 
        could just hook up like any VFD, and Sumitomo claims a range of 120:1 
        for their HF-430 unit in sensorless mode and that with a speed accuracy 
        of 0.5%. But it gets even better. Add the encoder board and put a suitable 
        encoder on the motor and now they're claiming a range of 1000:1 and speed 
        accuracy of 0.05%! That's starting to be quite a range, and these drives 
        have gotten a lot cheaper over time. I came across this particular one 
        in an eBay buy it now for $249 for a 3 HP unit.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only thing 
        missing from it seems to be true servo operation, or at least a means 
        of parking the spindle at a known location. True servo operation would 
        allow the spindle to be indexed to any arbitrary position. You can imagine 
        that would be handy if you wanted to set up your lathe spindle with a 
        3 HP motor (or more) and treat it as a C-axis. Index to a location, put 
        an air powered spindle on your CNC gang slide, and you can suddenly drill 
        a bolt circle for a flange under CNC power. A parking position would make 
        implementing a tool changer for a mill a lot more feasible. Park the spindle 
        in a known location and the &quot;dogs&quot; on the toolholder are properly 
        lined up.</font></p>

        To engage one of the speeds, the idler pulley is triggered to apply tension 
        to the belt being engaged by an air cylinder, visible in the picture above. A belt guide keeps the belt that isn't engaged from getting tangled up:</p>

      <p class="style1" align="center">Fadal Spindle Belt Guide...</p>
      <p class="style1" align="left">Node the ridges, and the way the top belt has a shelf to support it. The ridges allow a little bit of belt slippage without too much surface area for the belt that is disengaged. Not too hard to imagine the bottom belt 
        just sitting there quietly. If tension is removed, it will flex out and 
        not be driven. In addition, it is held slightly out of the way by gravity.        </p>
<p class="style1" align="left">Given the ratios available, the &quot;hi&quot; 
  gear will drive the spindle at 2x motor speed and the &quot;lo&quot; gear 
  will drive it at 1/2 motor speed. Couple that with a 3600 rpm motor and 
  you should have a range that extends from a hundred rpm all the way to 
  7,200 rpm. If you can overspeed the motor safely, you can get to the magic 
  10,000 rpm number. The Fadal-style transmission is also relatively compact. 
  It seems an ideal addition to the project if I can figure it out. I might 
  even build a manually operated prototype and look into air cylinders later.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="style1">What ho! The game is afoot!</p>
      <p class="style1">Cruiser is documenting his belt drive conversion experience 
        <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35961">over on 
        the CNCZone</a> as we speak. In the same thread he has also gotten jiggy 
        with the idea of attaching some linear slides to the sides of the IH column 
        to help facilitate the Z-axis and overcome some of the stick slip from 
        the poor marriage of a heavy head and very average dovetail ways. That's 
        also quite an interesting mod:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/IHLinearRails.jpg" width="640" height="853"> 
      </p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Cruiser uses a router tied to the 
        existing dovetail slide to cut a bed for his linear slides. Cool!</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Here is one &quot;teaser&quot; photo:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/IHBeltDrive.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Go check out the CNCZone thread for full 
        details! </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1"><strong>5/12/07</strong>: I thought I'd add 
        a little progress update. Cruiser has completed his belt conversion. One 
        thing Cruiser mentioned is that his belt drive is not working very well 
        at slow speeds--torque falls off rapidly. I believe he's running a little 
        under a 2:1 ratio on the motor to get it to not quite 6000 rpm. The motor 
        seems to be good to half speed and then torque falls off rapidly. This 
        may be a problem for cutting steel, although he has tried some passes 
        at 3000 rpm with limited success (currently fighting a noise problem of 
        some sort). </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">My conclusion on this is that a back gear 
        of some kind is needed for low speed operation. There's just too much 
        loss of torque at low speeds if you try to run belts directly with no 
        ability to change gear ratios. One could use something as simple as cone 
        pulleys to provide different rations, or something more complex like the 
        variable pitch pulleys I have discussed below. Another idea is to use 
        a much bigger motor, so that the torque drop off is less noticeable. For 
        example, these mills start out at 2 HP. A 5HP motor should notionally 
        be able to run at 1/4 rpm and have the torque of a 2 HP. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">To get an idea, I did some rough back of 
        envelope calculations. Let's say your motor is great down to 1/2 rpm, 
        so a 3400 rpm motor is good at 1700 rpm. Let's further say you want to 
        preserve torque to run at 100 rpm. I've worked out some possibilities 
        in this spreadsheet:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/BeltDrive/SpindleRatios.jpg" width="634" height="507"> 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The spreadsheet estimates horsepower available 
        on the assumption that:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- The motor will deliver full horsepower 
        down to 1/2 speed. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Below 1/2 speed, HP falls of in direct 
        proportion to how far the rpm is from rated speed.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- You can't run the motor over its rated 
        speed. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I've experimented with drive ratios, which 
        are listed along the top 2 rows, as well as motor horsepower, listed right 
        below. The numbers in the sheet are &quot;estimated horsepower&quot;. 
        They're likely bogus as exact horsepower figures, but helpful as a guideline. 
        If I had less than 0.2 horsepower, I marked that off in pink as being 
        unusable. If I had less than 0.5 horsepower, it is marked yellow--probably 
        usable if you go slow with a cutter that won't take much horsepower. To 
        give an idea of some high horsepower operations, I played with ME Consultant 
        Pro and came up with big twist drills (always use lots of power) and a 
        4&quot; indexable face mill. When cutting tool steel, they need 1.2HP. 
        This just to give some &quot;worst case&quot; checks.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">My conclusion from all of this:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Bumping up to 5 horsepower doesn't buy 
        you a lot more speed range. It's pretty similar (not surprisingly) to 
        a 2:1 back gear.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- A 2:1 back gear is essential for lower 
        horsepower motors just to survive with steel. 5 HP with a 2:1 back gear 
        gets you all the way down to 100 rpm.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- 5:1 back gear is too wide a spread with 
        a 2 HP motor. You'd have a dead zone from 800 - 1500 rpm. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- 3:1 back gear 2HP looks about right to 
        me. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I like the use of a variable pitch pulley 
        for system for back gear. Hey, if it was good enough for Bridgeport, its 
        good enough for me!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">You can use the variable pitch as your hi/lo 
        shift mechanism. That means the vari pulley needs enough total ratio to 
        cover the back gear + high speed. So, using the numbers above, for a 6000 
        rpm spindle that's 2 * 1.8 = at least a 3.5:1 vari pulley setup. For an 
        8K spindle (which I'm aiming for), you'd need 4.8:1. I'd run the system 
        with preset stops. Probably 3 stops on the range is good, and use the 
        VFD to fine control speeds within a stop.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">A 2-stage system could use a 2:1 back gear 
        and a 3:1 varispeed to get up to a 6:1 advantage, for real power down 
        low. Some kind of tumbler system like the lathe guys use could work for 
        the back gear shift. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">An alternate gear train option would be a 
        planetary gear set for low speed operation. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">1964 Patent on Grinding Duplex Bearings </p>
      <p class="style1">Available on Google, search for patent #<a href="http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT3330634&id=VMBoAAAAEBAJ&dq=duplex+bearing+grinding+fixture">3330634</a>. 
      </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Another Thought on Making Up Duplex Bearing Sets </p>
      <p class="style1">It seems most of the time that preload is going to be 
        specified as pounds. For example, NCCams claims that 150lbs for a pair 
        (75 lbs each) is the proper minimum loading for angular contact bearings 
        holding a ballscrew. I keep trying to envision how to go about getting 
        the bearings ground for that sort of preload. I presented my load cell 
        idea below, but here is another idea. </p>
      <p class="style1">Let's build a little fixture that uses some Belleville 
        washer springs to come up with 75 lbs of preload. I can get 40lb Belleville 
        springs from <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/">McMaster-Carr</a> very 
        cheaply. These springs are 0.312&quot; in diameter, 0.025&quot; thick 
        uncompressed, and they reach their desired load after 0.004&quot; of travel. 
        So let's design a preload fixture:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/BeltDrive/BearingPreloader.jpg" width="1024" height="630"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The preloader works by applying compressing 
        the Belleville washers (red) with a 1/4-20 socket head cap screw (blue) 
        from the bottom. This compression is transferred by an anvil (green) that 
        meets up with the bearing's inner races (bearing is purple) and forces 
        them up by whatever amount the 75 lbs manages. Before use, the fixture 
        is calibrated by placing the desired preload weight atop the anvil and 
        screwing in the cap screw until the weight is just lifted up.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Once calibrated, a bearing is placed on the 
        anvil, and the slotted top piece is bolted down onto the fixture to hold 
        the outer races flat against the surface of the fixture. A small section 
        of the bearing's inner races will protrude. The fixture with bearing needs 
        to be run through a surface grinder until it &quot;sparks out&quot; against 
        the outer races, indicating that the inner races are now flush despite 
        the preload.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">If the fixture were to be used a lot, various 
        sizes of cap and top anvil could be made up to suit different bearing 
        sizes. The only requirement is that the anvil not contact the area very 
        much outside the inner races, and the cap be made to only hold down the 
        outer races and provide access to the inners.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I designed this fixture to be largely made 
        on the lathe because that's where I think most will get their greatest 
        accuracy. For best precision it seems to me the top and bottom of the 
        cap as well as the top and bottom of the fixture's main barrel should 
        also be ground flat and parallel. The slot in the cap need not be precision, 
        and can simply be milled out. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1"><b>Addendum (12/9/08)</b></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Slocum's Precision Machine Design book describes 
        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6pd7uu">a method very similar to this</a>

      <p class="BlogTitle">On the Matter of Cheap vs Expensive Angular Contact 
        Bearings for Ballscrews and Spindles </p>
      <p class="style1">Without ball bearings of various types, machine tools 
        would be impossible. Their most critical applications involve ballscrew 
        mounting and spindles. Unfortunately, these very same critical applications 
        often call out for very expensive bearings that are out of reach for hobby 
        class machine work. I have a confession to make:<strong> I harbor a deep 
        resentment for those expensive &quot;machine tool quality&quot; angular 
        contact bearings. </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">It may be an unreasonable resentment from some perspectives. 
        NCCams over on CNCZone will tell you all day long that you get what you 
        pay for and you have to buy the most expensive bearings you can't afford, 
        but my resentment leads me to wonder whether it is all really necessary. 
        Yes, if I'm building a vertical machining center with micron accuracy 
        that's capable of 600 ipm rapids, I'm sure they're necessary. NCCams has 
        built a precision machine used to make camshafts for NASCAR winning seems, 
        surely a very exacting application, and one that needed great bearings. 
        But do I really need those costly bearings to do an <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">6K 
        rpm spindle for a hobby mill</a>? Do I need them for a ballscrew bearing 
        block on a machine I hope will be repeatable to a thousandth? I feel the 
        resentment is reasonable for the hobby machines. Someone needs to speak 
        for them! </p>
      <p class="style1">There are tantalizing clues about this conundrum that 
        I run across from time to time, and it always perks up my interest. Some 
        examples:</p>
      <p class="style1">- I am told by various sources that garden variety bearings 
        of today are every bit as accurate as the machine tool quality bearings 
        of the 40's and 50's.</p>
      <p class="style1">- Many Asian-built machines such as the Tormach mills 
        do not use ABEC7 bearings, they get by on lesser grades. </p>
      <p class="style1">- See my blog post below &quot;When the wrong bearings&quot; 
        wherein I explore the use of multiple deep groove bearings to achieve 
        levels of stiffness comparable to angular contact bearings. I can't see 
        why 4 of these dirt cheap bearings couldn't be made to perform like $400-600 
        worth of expensive AC bearings. This article is also copied on the <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">belt 
        drive page</a>. </p>
      <p class="style1">- See my notes on the <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">belt 
        drive page</a> about how to go about hand fitting unmatched bearing pairs 
        to be preloaded duplex pairs. </p>
      <p class="style1">- I constantly see examples where machinists are able 
        to get superior performance from worn out or inferior machinery because 
        they know the right tricks. Why can't that be true here too? </p>
      <p class="style1">All of this will sound like a lot of sour grapes belly 
        aching on costs and snake oil selling to those professionals who think 
        nothing of just specing the expensive bearings designed to do the job. 
        They may be right, but I have a sneaking suspicion there is more to it 
        than this. Why might the professionals use expensive bearings if cheaper 
        ones would do? I can think of several reasons.</p>
      <p class="style1">First, look at it from the standpoint of manufacturing 
        repeatability. Machine tools have to be warranted to certain performance 
        levels despite variations in their construction and component parts. Tightening 
        up the specs on the components makes it less likely the tolerances will 
        stack up poorly and a machine will leave the line that isn't up to specs. 
        The science of Six Sigmas and quality control will tell you it is cheaper 
        to set up the manufacturing process to avoid these mistakes in the first 
        place rather than find them after the machines are built and have to rework 
        the out of spec machines. So the overall cost to mass produce a machine 
        may be less while the individual cost of a single machine may be more.</p>
      <p class="style1">Second, consider the warranty aspects and especially durability 
        and wear considerations. An expensive machine tool sold for production 
        business use will be expected to run tirelessly around the clock day after 
        day in order to justify its cost. A hobby or light use machine need not 
        be so durable in order to fulfill its purpose. Also, for many manufacturers, 
        the warranty cost of a failure is very expensive to cure. The cost to 
        an individual to fix their hobby machine themselves may be so much lower 
        they're much more willing to risk it. I read somewhere on CNCZone of a 
        fellow running a CNC router shop that uses hardware store routers and 
        buys crates of bearings for them. He says it costs about $2.50 to replace 
        each bearing and he gets 100 hours of continuous routing from a bearing. 
        To him it is worth it to keep on replacing cheap bearings. To Haas, who 
        sold you a very much more expensive gantry router and a warranty that 
        causes them to have to send someone out to fix your bearings if they break, 
        it isn't worth it.</p>
      <p class="style1">Third, commercial machines have a radically different 
        performance envelope than hobby machines. We kid ourselves we can do what 
        they do, but we can't. We may be able to get a part made that is very 
        close, but it will take us much longer to do it. We don't run nearly the 
        rapids, we often run steppers instead of servos, cutting loads are probably 
        much less, we are babying our cutters and our machines, while the pros 
        are cranking out 110% on the spindle load meters and creating so many 
        chips our little home shops would be buried in no time if we tried it 
        (not to mention all the other problems!). What we really care about most 
        in these hobby class machines is accuracy and repeatability, and not all 
        that much of that. Maybe someday the cutting speeds and efficiencies will 
        matter to us, but for now, we'd just like to get the parts made reliably 
        to a thousandth or so. I submit that this is a far simpler requirement 
        than what most of these high end expensive bearings are being designed 
        to deliver, and that we can therefore get by on less. The level of accuracy 
        and performance needed to cut precision cams to be used in zillion dollar 
        NASCAR racing may be a touch more than what we really need to build tabletop 
        steam engines. </p>
      <p class="style1">Lastly, there is a labor intensiveness factor that matters 
        more to the manufacturer and less to the hobbyist (or to the Asian manufacturer 
        for that matter!). If I am a hobbyist, I can take the time needed to take 
        two relatively unmatched angular contact bearings and grind them for a 
        desired preload. I can then hand fit them to the shafts and bores they'll 
        live in, lapping, honing, or using whatever means is necessary to achieve 
        a good result. If an experiment of this kind is marginal or fails, I can 
        always try again and perhaps do better the second time. Most of the investment 
        I have in is just time. OTOH, if I am a manufacturer, unless my labor 
        is extremely cheap, I want no part of that process. I will spend quite 
        a bit of premium to buy a matched pair of preloaded AC bearings off the 
        shelf so I don't have to mess with grinding them and trial and error. 
        A really fancy set of these bearings is maybe $800. It takes surprisingly 
        little shop time for someone to run up $800 of labor, and they may screw 
        it up! If I just buy the bearings, they're guaranteed and someone else 
        takes the risk for the screw ups. Hence I just buy the bearings if I'm 
        a manufacturer. Things were not always this way. Bridgeport used to hand 
        fit spindle bearings, for example. Not because it made a better mill, 
        but because it was cheaper than buying more expensive bearings at the 
        labor rates in those days. </p>
      <p class="style1">This piece has been more of a rant than anything else, 
        so I understand if you arent' convinced, but let me leave you with the 
        anecdote I read this morning that set me off. <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/topic/30/4158.html">A 
        fellow on PM was asking about ballscrew bearings for his Bridgeport Series 
        I CNC</a>. He got on the phone to Bridgeport at the suggestion of one 
        member, and was told that each axis would cost $650 to $875 just for the 
        bearings. OUCH!!! He probably paid less than the cost of the 3 sets of 
        bearings for the whole machine! </p>
      <p class="style1">Along comes another member with the same machine who bought 
        a cheap pair of unmatched AC bearings off eBay for $35. He got after them 
        with a surface grinder to grind the inner races to create a preload condition, 
        installed them on his machine, and measured 0.0008&quot; play while still 
        being able to turn the ballscrew relatively freely (too much preload will 
        make the screw stiff and there will be a tradeoff between less play and 
        too much stiffness). Backlash of 0.0008&quot; would be fine for hobbyists 
        wanting to machine with 0.001&quot; accuracy. The price is right and a 
        small amount of labor delivered this happy ending. Would a manufacturer 
        do it this way? They probably would in China, but not from one of the 
        &quot;big name&quot; machine builders they wouldn't! </p>

        one of the famous bearing rants for either spindles or ballscrew mounting. 
        Closely allied are the drill press mill rants. <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34883">Some

      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>You too can build a milling machine 
        from a drill press...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Someone commented that this design was a 
        nightmare and the guy obviously didn't know what he was doing because 
        he had installed 5 deep groove ball bearings and a single tapered bearing 
        that was in backwards of all things. You just can't do that--it ain't 
        right!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">&quot;Hmmm,&quot; says I. When I hear that 
        you can't do something, I kind of want to know why the guy did it anyway 
        and how well it worked. It occured to me that perhaps this guy was clever 
        like a fox. I sniffed around his site a bit more and learned he was a 
        Professor of Mechanical Engineering with full Piled Higher and Deeper 
        credentials. Now I am nto one who is intimidated by credentials having 
        attended graduate school and met many of these sort of fellows. At the 
        same time I do not immediately assume any PhD is an idiot either. This 
        guy piled on 5 deep groove and 1 upside down tapered roller bearing for 
        a reason, and it became my mission to figure it out.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It didn't take me too long to decide that 
        maybe he was just stacking the bearings to make up for their inherent 
        weaknesses. One often hears about stacking 3 or even 4 angular contact 
        bearings to increase rigidity. So I dragged out my bearing catalogs and 
        had a look at what this might mean.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">From the NSK bearing catalog I found a nice 
        comparison of the strengths of various kinds of bearings. We can see that 
        deep groove bearings are primarily limited in that their load capacity 
        is not as good as angular contact bearings:</p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">So I decided to try to set up a comparison 
        of the radial and axial load capacities for similar sized bearings of 
        different types. There are formulas in the NSK catalog that may be used 
        to compute the load capacity of up to 4 stacked bearings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double:&nbsp; 1.62x Radial, 2xAxial</li>
        <li> Triple:&nbsp; 2.15xRadial, 3xAxial</li>
        <li> Quadruple:&nbsp; 2.64xRadial, 4xAxial</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="style1">You can see that axial loads are additive 
        but radial loads don't get 4x the value when you stack 4 bearings. In 
        fact they aren't even 3x as strong radially when 4 bearings are stacked. 
        That's going to be the weakpoint I suspect. The results are interesting.

      <p align="left" class="style1">Guess what? The double AC bearing configuration 
        is bested by a triple 6204 bearing arrangement! Now if we want ABEC7's, 
        the duplex AC bearings are still a bit cheaper, but if we're fooling with 
        more &quot;stock&quot; bearings, it seems like we can get a more rigid 
        arrangement for less money using the deep groove bearings.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I'm sure it is probably not quite so easy, 
        but it is certainly intriguing. It wouldn't cost much to build a test 
        rig and see how well the deep grooves perform when stacked. Now I'm sure 
        the bearing gurus are spinning up to full whirling dervish speed to jump 
        all over this concept, but I remain unrepentant until I see someone hook 
        them up and make them play.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1"><strong>What about the really expensive bearings?</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">A duplex pair of the much vaunted 20TAC47B 
        purpose-built for ballscrews angular contact bearings turns in an axial 
        load value of 26,600N. That's better than 3 stacked 7204's! However, note 
        that the quadruple 6204's begins to approach this value at 26,400N. Also 
        note that 20TAC47B's cost $800 the pair. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Can 4 of these cheap bearings do ballscrew 
        duty as well as the $800 TAC's? That's a scary thing to spring on the 
        bearing gurus. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It remains to be seen, but I would sure love 
        to try the experiment someday! </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Variable Pitch Pulleys </p>
      <p class="style1">I worry about the effective operating range of a belt 
        driven spindle that has only one drive ratio. The differences in speeds 
        when going from steel to aluminum are extremely large. While we can make 
        the motor run slowly for steel with a VFD, it will lose a tremendous amount 
        of torque in the process. For this reason, most machines have at least 
        2 drive ratios. A low or back gear is used for cutting steel, while the 
        high gear is used for aluminum and other materials requiring higher spindle 
        rpms. One of the mechanisms used to effect these differing ratios is the 
        classic cone pulley arrangement. This is painful because it requires a 
        manual operation to swap the belt over to a different ratio. </p>
      <p class="style1">A little better is a back gear arrangement, which could 
        be done similar to the &quot;tumbler&quot; reverse arrangement that is 
        so popular for lathes. If this is done, one would thing the ideal thing 
        is to have the gears driven directly from the motor such that the output 
        of the tumbler gears is either 1:1 the motor's speed or 1/2 the motor's 
        speed. This would then be multiplied via belt pulleys to get to the desired 
        maximum spindle rpm. For example, let's say we have a 1500 rpm motor and 
        we want to run at a maximum of 8000 rpm on the spindle. This calls for 
        a 5.3:1 pulley ratio driving the spindle. If the back gear runs the motor 
        at 1/2 speed, we would have 2 ranges: 0 to 4000 rpm and 4000 to 8000 rpm. 
        So even when we run the spindle at 100 rpm, our motor is running at 100/5.3 
        * 2 or about 38 rpm. If the back gear had a 3:1 ratio, at 100 rpm we'd 
        be running 56 rpm whereas at 8000 rpm we'd still be running 1500 rpm on 
        our motor.</p>
      <p class="style1">This is not bad, but back gears are going to be noisy, 
        and we will have to fabricate a tumbler mechanism. Another approach to 
        consider is a variable pitch pulley. In this arrangement, the pulley sheave 
        is constructed of two halves that can separate and allow the belt to move 
        in and out to various diameters. It's a really flexible system found in 
        a lot of &quot;pro&quot; machine tools. Here is the variable pitch pulley 
        still attached to the motor for a Bridgeport 2J head:</p>

      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Bridgeport Variable Pitch Pulley...

      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Bridgeport variable disc...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">These pieces almost look simple enough to 
        build from scratch. My main issue with that is I don't understand them 
        well enough to be sure my design would work well or to debug it if it 
        didn't. I am probably better off to try to acquire one. </p>
      <p class="style1">Variable pitch pulleys are available commercially from 
        places like <a href="http://www.lovejoy-inc.com/variablespeeddrives.htm">Lovejoy</a>, 
        but they do not look cheap. Interestingly, they are also available from 
        the go kart industry where they're referred to as &quot;<a href="http://www.gokartsupply.com/asymapp.htm">torque 
        converters</a>&quot; and are much cheaper. The go kart variety cost circa 
        $60 to 70 for a 3-5 HP capable pulley system capable of giving a 3:1 range. 
        One difference is that the go kart system changes its ratio based on the 
        speed the motor is turning at using a centrifigul weight system. I don't 
        know that you'd want that in a machine tool (although you might), but 
        it seems like it ought to be possible to replace the centrifigul mechanism 
        with a manually adjustable system. </p>
      <p class="style1">For comparison a Bridgeport has a back gear and a vari-speed 
        (variable pitch pulley) system. The back gear delivers 2 speed ranges: 
        60 to 500 rpm and 500 rpm to 4200 rpm. From this, we can see that the 
        back gear has a range of 500/60 = 8.3:1--quite a stout back gear ratio! 
        The vari-speed system provides a further 8:1 variability range. Meanwhile, 
        because this was all done mechanically, the motor is free to run at all 
        times at its designed rpm, ensuring that maximum power is being delivered 
        to the spindle. </p>
      <p class="style1">By contrast, most VFD based systems are going to produce 
        less power as the spindle slows down almost in direct proportion to how 
        slowly the spindle is run. So the 8:1 range offered by the vari-speed 
        system on the Bridgie means a reduction to 1/8th the power because the 
        motor is running so slowly at the lower speeds. With the capability of 
        maintaining the power supplied by the motor at constant levels due to 
        infinitely variable pulley ratios, it is no wonder the Bridgeports and 
        other commerical mills can outperform simpler amateur designs! A VFD can 
        do a little better than this. According to a <a href="http://www.reliance.com/pdf/drives/whitepapers/D7161.pdf">white 
        paper by Reliance Electric</a>, they can hold constant horsepower over 
        a 2:1 speed range. If you have the cash for a fancy vector drive, you 
        can expand that ratio to 4:1, which is why the big VMC makers like Haas 
        use vector drives to run their spindles. </p>
      <p class="style1">If we add a go kart torque converter to our VFD only system, 
        it has a 3:1 range. Let's say that rather than running from say 100 to 
        3000 rpm on the motor, this lets us run the motor at 300 to 3000 rpm. 
        At the bottom end we're getting 3x as much torque as the VFD-only system. 
        That seems a decent improvement. Of course the Bridgeport is generating 
        8x as much power at the lower end of its range, and the ranges are chosen 
        to be an 8x spread of rpm for that reason so that the motor always delivers 
        full power. For our example, 300 to 3000 rpm is a 10:1 range that the 
        VFD has to span. Better than the original 30:1 range, but it means we 
        may be looking at 1/10th the power at the bottom end. The trouble is the 
        low end may be precisely where we want more power because we're cutting 
        some really tough material.</p>
      <p class="style1">Let's say we add a Hi/Lo back gear system to our go kart 
        vari-speed system. Further, let's say we're doing so for a 100 to 8000 
        rpm spindle range, such as we're trying to design for this belt driven 
        mill head. We have a motor that runs at 3000 rpm. With a 3:1 vari-speed, 
        if we want to keep the Bridgeport ideal of max motor power throughout 
        the range, we can allow a 3x variation. So, the top gear would run 2600 
        rpm to 8000 rpm, and the bottom gear would run 888 to 2600 rpm. Our back 
        gear would be a matching 3:1 ratio. If we want to run more slowly than 
        888 rpm in low gear, we're looking at running the range down further than 
        the vari-speed can compensate for with the VFD. 100 = 1/8th, so we have 
        1/8th the horsepower available at the slowest speed. Given the VFD allows 
        a 2:1 range, we may have more like 1/4 the horsepower. If we tried to 
        cover that whole range without a back gear or vari-speed, we would be 
        looking at 100/8000 = 1/80th the horsepower at the lowest speed! </p>
      <p class="style1">One issue that is going to develop from use of a vari-speed 
        system is getting Mach 3 to understand what speed the spindle is really 
        moving at. Imagine a system that mates a go kart &quot;torque converter&quot; 
        to a VFD equipped motor. Let's leave the centrifigul feature in place 
        so that the torque multiplication at lower rpms is automatic. One wonders 
        how repeatable speeds will be. Mach is built without a closed loop to 
        a spindle tachometer, so the assumption is that response to a given Mach 
        3 voltage level will always produce the same rpm. There is a provision 
        for a &quot;pulley&quot; setting to allow Mach 3 to take back gears and 
        the like into account, but this is discrete and not continuously variable. 
      </p>
      <p class="style1">This concept needs more thought and research, but some 
        sort of back gearing mechanism or variable speed pulley seems a must for 
        this project. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">How Warm Should Spindle Bearings Run? </p>
      <p class="style1">The answer is at their design temperature, of course, 
        but since we are designing this spindle, it is worth looking around to 
        see what other spindles are recommended to run at. Below are some references, 
        but it looks like one should shoot for a range of 100 to 140 degrees F. 
        Keep in mind that we want to avoid a thermal runaway situation where the 
        heat expands the spindle, which creates more friction, more heat, more 
        expansion, etc., etc.</p>

          degrees F. In fact, they suggest a proper break-in procedure involves 
          running the spindle until it reaches 150 degrees F, turning it off to 
          cool, and repeating the cycle until the spindle stabilizes at 130 degrees 
          F or lower operating temp. The ideal equilibrium operating temperature 
          is 95 to 115 degrees F. Maximum temperatures should not exceed 170 degrees

      <p class="BlogTitle">Belt Speeder Design Sketch </p>
      <p class="style1">Below is a sketch of what <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?p=245048#post245048">Barry 
        Ward called a &quot;belt speeder&quot;</a>:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/BeltDrive/BeltSpeederSketch.jpg" width="1024" height="714"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>A belt speeder...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The belt speeder is designed to plug into 
        your existing R8 taper and clamp around the quill. Internally, it uses 
        timing belts and pulleys to multiply the speed of the spindle. A compact 
        spindle cartridge to the right contains another R8 taper which will now 
        be travelling at 2.5x whatever the main spindle is doing. You could define 
        the timing pulleys to create larger ratios if desired. I just did a quick 
        sketch after hearing Barry mention it to get an idea of what one might 
        be like. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Some of my thoughts about this setup:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- I'm not real happy with how bulky it seems. 
        This makes me wonder about rigidity. Serious thought would need to be 
        given to getting it well clamped to the mill.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- The offset allows access to a short drawbar 
        for the new taper from the top. If I were to build one of these, I'd want 
        a power drawbar arrangement there, I've sworn off hand wrenching drawbars 
        for life since <a href="CCMillDrawbar.html">building my power drawbar</a>!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Since the spindle cartridge is so short, 
        it may be possible to build it with just 2 angular contact bearings (one 
        at either end). Need to consider thermal expansion when doing so.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">In the end of the day, I am still convinced 
        a new mill head is the best bet for me, but for a lot of other folks, 
        a removable spindle speeder may be a nicer idea. Certainly if you have 
        a big mill like Barry's Shizuoka CNC mill, it's probably hard to consider 
        building a new head for it. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">One other thing that goes through my head 
        is whether a planetary gear arrangement couldn't be built. I have purchased 
        on eBay a 4x spindle speeder to look at (it was cheap):</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/BeltDrive/YuasaSpeeder.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Yuasa Spindle Speeder</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">My thought is whether one couldn't use the 
        planetary gearset from an automatic transmission to do this job. They 
        are available very cheaply from many sources, including eBay. In fact, 
        I purchased a set to build a fancy collet chuck (another project I still 
        haven't gotten to!):</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Bearing Speed Factor (dN) and Bearing Lubrication = 
        Oil Mist or Oil Lubrication </p>
      <p class="style1">Bearing speed factor is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p class="style1">dN = N x (ID + OD) / 2 where N = spindle rpm, ID = bearing 
        inner diameter, and OD = bearing outer diameter.</p>
      <p class="style1">So, for the example of this spindle, we're looking at 
        7207 bearings and 8000 rpm, so we get a dN value of:</p>
      <p class="style1">8000 x (35 + 72) / 2 = 428,000</p>
      <p class="style1">What does this tell us? It gives us an idea of what kind 
        of lubrication we need to consider. Assuming we get the preload correct 
        for the bearings, we must still get the lubrication right or the bearings 
        will overheat and fail. If we are even marginally off on preload, we're 
        going to need some safety margin on the lubrication front as well, so 
        we don't want to flirt with the theoretical maximums. </p>
      <p class="style1">The theoretical maximum for grease lubricated AC bearings 
        is a dN of 850,000. However, if we <a href="http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/hsm9802.html">consult 
        the literature from Barden bearing</a>, we will see that this requires 
        a pretty specialized grease to achieve, and that more typical values for 
        dN are 400,000 to 600,000. My conclusion looking at that information is 
        that we ought to consider oil mist lubrication for this spindle project. 
        It has a theoretical limit of 1,500,000 dN, which seems like it gives 
        a much better margin for error. Oil misters are inexpensive and readily 
        available, so it seems like it would be straightforward to add oil mist 
        cooling to a cartridge spindle such as the one we are contemplating here. 
        Below is a graph showing spindle speed versus bearing speed factor for 
        the 7202 bearings that will be used for this spindle project. </p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/BeltDrive/BearingSpeedGraph.jpg" width="705" height="502"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Bearing Speed Factor for 7207 AC 
        Bearings Showing Grease vs Oil Lubrication Regimes </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">It is interesting to note that your basic modern CNC milling 
        machine spindle, such as a Haas, typically uses oil mist lubrication. 
        I don't know if I will go to the trouble of an oil mist or not, but it 
        seems worth considering at least. What's needed is to test the spindle 
        and monitor temperatures and preloads. If they do okay, there is no need 
        for the added complexity. If they are marginal, its worth looking into. 
        The other thought is that it is easy to see why 8000 rpm is a difficult 
        number for this project as it sits right on the cusp. 6500 rpm or 7000 
        rpm (if you are feeling luck) would be a slam dunk for greased bearings. 
        And that's just where a lot of commercial knee mills wind up. </p>
      <p class="style1">HuFlungDung, who has rebuilt the spindle on his Haas VF3, 
        mentioned that the oil mist system on the Haas is dead simple:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="style1">&quot;FWIW, when I overhauled my Haas spindle cartridge, 
          which has oil mist, I was expecting some kind of high faluting thingy 
          inside for the oil mist, but it is dead simple. Basically, the air/oil 
          line feeds into a sintered bronze filter above the top bearing. That 
          is it! No special passages, no nothing, just gravity Air comes out the 
          bottom of the spindle around a close fitting labyrinth end cap. The 
          oil volume required is very low.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Thoughts About Preload and Duplex Bearings </p>
      <p class="style1">Anyone researching the problem of building a spindle quickly 
        discovers that the majority of cost and difficulty has to do with the 
        bearings. Quality spindles benefit from angular contact bearings fitted 
        in opposing configurations that maximize their axial and radial stiffness 
        while providing as little turning resistance (and likely heating) as possible 
        in the desired operating envelope. The traditional commercial approach 
        to the problem is to fit two or more angular contact bearings to the spindle 
        in matched duplex configuration and to use extremely accurate ABEC7 bearings. 
        This is where the cost enters the equation. There is a high premium paid 
        for the ABEC7 accuracy, as well as a high cost paid for the duplex pairs 
        versus just buying two bearings. The reason is that both require additional 
        manufacturing cost, and also limit the applicability of the bearings so 
        there are fewer available in the surplus markets. One does scare up the 
        odd bargain, but it can't be counted on.</p>
      <p class="style1">It has seemed to me that I can dispense with ABEC7. The 
        difference in precision between ABEC7 and the next lower grade, which 
        is ABEC5, is only 0.2 ten thousands of an inch of runout. For any concievable 
        HSM project, this is not a meaningful difference, provided the rest of 
        the operating parameters such as desired RPM range can be met by the lower 
        precision bearings.</p>
      <p class="style1">What's more difficult is the requirement for duplex bearings. 
        Duplexing is the process of modifying a set of bearings by grinding the 
        edge of either the inner and outer races so that when the bearings are 
        butted up against one another, there is a precise gap. When the gap is 
        eliminated, it results in a precise amount of preload being applied in 
        a very controlled way to the interior of the bearings. This is simple, 
        repeatable, and performs very well in commercial applications, but these 
        matched pairs are much more expensive than individual angular contact 
        bearings that do not have to be matched. With individual bearings, one 
        can create the preload either using springs, or by fabricating a spacer 
        that forces just the inner (or outer) races apart by an amount that is 
        similar to the result of the duplex machining operation. </p>
      <p class="style1">I will leave the spring approach aside as I have doubts 
        about its stability for a spindle application like this, but I will also 
        readily admit it needs more research. The problem with the spacer approach 
        is twofold. First, that spacer has to be accurately machined to very tight 
        tolerances measured in tenths. Typically they would be ground, though 
        it is possible also to do most of the work on a lathe. In any event, achieving 
        these tolerances is hard in a home shop. Second, one does not know what 
        the thickness of the spacer or shim needs to be to generate the optimal 
        preload. </p>
      <p class="style1">My thought on determining the right shim thickness for 
        a given preload would be to create a special load cell that simulates 
        the bearing application and use that load cell to measure the effective 
        preload as various shim thicknesses are experimented with. For a DB configuration, 
        which is most desireable for a spindle (its the stiffest), the inner rings 
        would be ground. This is simulated by shimming the outer ring. Now the 
        load cell has to measure the amount of force needed to bring the inner 
        rings into contact for a given amount of shim between the outer rings. 
        The load cell preload testing rig looks like this:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CADDrawings/NMTB30/PreloadLoadCell.jpg" width="705" height="800"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Load Cell Testing Rig for Bearing 
        Preload...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The load cell (Red), is a simple cylinder 
        filled with mineral oil and equipped with a pressure gauge. The piston 
        has a little tool (Light Blue) attached to it that bears against the bearing 
        inner race (Dark Blue) while a similar tool bears against the second bearing's 
        inner race. The two bearings are installed in a model spindle (Purple), 
        complete with shaft, and are separated by a precision spacer. The outer 
        races are held by another piece of tooling (Gray/White) as well as by 
        their press fit in the model spindle. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">To use the test rig, stand it up in an arbor 
        press and apply force to the top inner race tool. Force could also be 
        applied using weights or by tightening a screw. It should be possible 
        to increase this force until the inner races of the two bearings are tight 
        against one another. Since force is applied to the top bearing, no load 
        will register on the lower bearing until the two races are in contact. 
        At that point, further increases in force are passed through, so we need 
        to look for the minimum force that will register on the test rig, and 
        this will be the preload that is generated by the spacer between the bearings. 
        A thinner spacer will result in less preload, while a thicker spacer results 
        in more preload. It will be necessary to follow a test regimen that involves 
        several spacers being tested until the appropriate preload is achieved. 
        Unfortunately, we need to work our way from thinner to thicker spacers, 
        which will necessitate making more than one spacer in order to perform 
        the tests. In this way, it should be possible to create a desired preload 
        by substituting some labor in this testing and in the creation of spacers 
        for the purchase of more expensive duplex bearings. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I note from a <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=31832">CNCZone 
        thread</a> that Misumi will sell you a custom bearing spacer for $7.00. 
        I'd like to know more about the specs and tolerances, but that might be 
        just the ticket to preload bearings. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Fitting the Bearings </p>
      <p class="style1">Fitting bearings is a ticklish business, both from the 
        standpoint of the levels of accuracy required (measured in 10ths or 1/10,000 
        of an inch) and from the standpoint that the bearing is delicate, and 
        the application of too much force while installing can ruin it, while 
        too little force on the preload limits the accuracy and performance of 
        the spindle.</p>
      <p class="style1">Let's start by determining how much precision is required. 
        I consulted the Fafnir Super Precision Bearing catalog as a good source 
        for this kind of information. The tolerances on the 2MM series of bearings 
        in the '07 size we are concerned with are as follows for ABEC-7:</p>
      <p class="style1">- ID Bore: +0.0000&quot; / -0.00025&quot;</p>
      <p class="style1">- OD: +0.0000&quot; / -0.0003&quot;</p>
      <p class="style1">- Seat Width: +0.0000&quot; / -0.0047&quot;</p>
      <p class="style1">- OD Square With Side: +0.0000&quot; / -0.00025&quot; 
      </p>
      <p class="style1">- Recommended Shaft Diameter: 1.3778&quot; to 1.3780&quot;</p>
      <p class="style1">- Housing Bore Diameter: 2.1654&quot; to 2.1657&quot; 
        (fixed end), 2.1659&quot; to 2.1657&quot; (floating end) </p>
      <p class="style1">Clearly we're talking just a couple of tenths of tolerances 
        here!</p>
      <p class="style1">I had read on 5Bears site of <a href="http://www.5bears.com/cnc16.htm">some 
        techniques which looked like one approach for an HSM</a> to achieve such 
        tolerances. One must take into account that Swede (who runs the site) 
        is an exceptional machinist, and that he is doing the work on a Hardinge 
        lathe (or clone), which was designed for precision from the start. Nevertheless, 
        I intend to give these techniques a try. What's lacking at present is 
        sufficient time spend improving my HSS tool grinding skills to get the 
        geometry that Sweded recommends for a fine shaving cutting tool:</p>

      <p align="center" class="style1">5Bears tool for making very fine cuts in 
        steel... </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Swede comments that you can make cuts no 
        greater than 0.004&quot; with the tool, but that by using your compound 
        at an angle for infeed you can cut as little as 0.0002&quot; or less! 
        That would be handy for sneaking up on tight dimensions.</p>

        final tune up. Flex-Hones are also referred to as &quot;chicken pluckers&quot; 
        or ball hones. I ordered one in the appropriate size (they cover about 
        a 1/4&quot; range) for the OD of my 7207 bearings off eBay for $35:</p>

      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Flex-hones are useful for fine 
        tuning and fine finish of bearing bores... </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">I have also heard of <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/topic/13/4683.html">using 
        reamers in floating holders (works great, but not sure about the 3&quot; 
        size for these kind of bearings!) as well as using a special roller burnishing 
        tool. </a>The latter seems worth more investigation. If one wants to ream, 
        Forrest Addy suggests boring to 0.005&quot; undersize at least for the 
        first part of the hole before applying the reamer. </p>
      <p class="style1"><span class="BlogTitle">Accurately Checking the Spindle 
        Measurements </span></p>
      <p class="style1">Another question that arises is how to measure one's progress 
        to tenths while performing these machining operations? For the shaft OD, 
        a micrometer would certainly suffice. I'm a bit more concerned about miking 
        the bearing bore with any accuracy. It seems like one of the three point 
        Intrimik bore mikes would be the ticket, albeit an expensive ticket at 
        that. Something else to look out for on eBay! The trouble with three point 
        mikes is that they can't measure out of roundness--the error is spread 
        over the three points. </p>
      <p class="style1">For that reason, the crowd 
        over on Practical Machinist</a> (not to mention Widgitmaster on CNCZone) 
        seem to feel a dial bore gage is in many ways a better bet than the Intrimik. 
        Forrest Addy, in another PM thread, concurs</a>. Forrest also suggest you will 
        need to lap them to final size and finish to get reliable results. If 
        you can obtain a dial bore gage with sufficient sensitivity, I think this 
        is the way to go. The PM crowd also favor the Mitutoyo dial bore gages, 
        but feel Sunnen have the best, albeit at great cost. Still others argue 
        that Standard makes the best bore gages. Enco has the Fowler digital bore 
        gages on sale as I write this for under $200. I am seriously tempted to 
        order one to cover this base:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/BeltDrive/FowlerBore.jpg" width="250" height="290"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Fowler digital bore gage w/ ring 
        gage for calibration... </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">Your dial bore gage has to be calibrated for maximum accuracy 
        as you are using it. The recommendation there is to calibrate it with 
        gage blocks. You stack them to get to the measurement you are looking 
        for, but a top and bottom on the stack, and then measure that distance 
        with the dial bore gage. The last comment I will make on this is that 
        NSK suggests a dial bore gage be used to check fits in their Super Precision 
        Machine Tool Bearing Catalog. They note that it is important to check 
        that the temperature of the components all be the same, an important tip 
        when measuring to tenths! </p>
      <p class="style1">Another interesting alternative is the use of pin gages. 
        <a href="http://www.myvirtualnetwork.com/mklotz/">Marv Klotz has a piece 
        of software called &quot;PLUG&quot; that will figure how to use 3 pins 
        to measure 1 larger hole</a>. Evan amplifies on this by saying he makes 
        special plug gages. They taper 0.001&quot; per inch and he just measures 
        how far they will go in and then use a little math to figure the hole 
        size. </p>
      <p class="style1">In a pinch, telescoping gages with a micrometer are probably 
        the cheapest method, and a lot of the machinists swear by them. Forrest 
        Addy suggests the following technique:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="style1">As for measuring bores to close tolarences I reccommend 
          telescope gages. They are self aligning. Insert the tool in the bore, 
          adjsut it a trifle oversize and snug the clamp, and sweep the handle 
          through a radial plane until the gage pops loose. One sweep and you're 
          done. Takes a couple of seconds. Quickly mike the gage without &quot;mashing 
          the reading&quot; between spindle and anvil. You should be able to hold 
          0.0002&quot; consistancy in size. Be careful of heat. If the bore seems 
          to be getting a trifle smaller with subsequent checks, chances are your 
          mike is picking up heat from your hands, expanding, and making your 
          appear reading small. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="style1">HuFlungDung adds the following useful hint with telescoping 
        gages: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="style1">Hint for using telescoping guages: oil the ends of the 
          gage, or oil the bore before sweeping the gage through. Part of the 
          skill is learning how tight to adjust the clamp so it will yield enough 
          to let the gage tips move in without excessive force.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Mounting the Spindle Cartridge </p>
      <p class="style1">Commercial units, such as the <a href="http://www.setcousa.com/files/files/S-0001-2 ProMetrix-HS.pdf">Setco 
        belt drive cartridge spindles</a>, are typically mounted using a flange 
        and machined cylindrical surfaces. Adding a flange either requires completely 
        boring solid stock or welding a flange to the DOM tubing and machining 
        both back to trueness. Another approach also found in Setco's line is 
        a rectangular block for the cartridge. This still requires considerable 
        machining effort. The likely material for such a block would be aluminum, 
        although Setco uses gray iron, which is also a possibility. Either a flange 
        or rectangular block simplifies the task of mounting the spindle cartridge 
        to the case considerably. </p>
      <p class="style1">For what it's worth, the Setco cartridge spindles run 
        with two angular contact bearings up front and two roller bearings in 
        back. The angular contact bearings are duplex but are not in contact, 
        and are separated from one another by an inch or two, and are run in a 
        &quot;DB&quot; (back to back) orientation, not &quot;DF&quot;. They offer 
        an optional 3 bearing nose system for even more rigidity. The design accomodates 
        swap in of the additional bearing simply by installing a new, shorter 
        spacer between the original two, which creates a DT-DB combination. Yet 
        another swap also a quad DT-DB combination to be installed for even higher 
        performance. </p>
      <p class="style1">Their F040-030M model is an NMTB #30 taper spindle cartridge. 
      </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Mill Head Sketches </p>
      <p class="style1">Here are some quick sketches in Rhino 3D of the mill head. 
        It is based on a 3 bearing design, with the duplex ABEC 7 <a href="http://bearingsdirect.com/products/index.php?action=item&id=292&prevaction=category&previd=4&prevstart=25">7207CTDULP4</a>'s 
        at the bottom and an ABEC 3 7206 BEP at top. I really think the duplexed 
        bearings that surround the toolholder will add tremendous rigidity. This 
        design is based on a couple of off-the-shelf timing pulleys, and on the 
        Leeson 192074 motor upgrade that Aaron recommends and that is sitting 
        in my garage as we speak. Based on a top speed of 3000 rpm from that motor, 
        and the 2.4:1 ratio'd set of pulleys, this yields a top spindle speed 
        of 7200 rpm, which is right what I am shooting at. McMaster Carr also 
        lists one larger pulley size, and these sketches will accomodate that 
        pulley as well. If one uses such a pulley, a spindle speed of 9000 rpm 
        would be generated at the top end. That seemed a bit much for me, but 
        the pulley is not that expensive to order and experiment with.</p>
      <p class="style1">There is a lot that is not considered by the sketches. 
        For example, how do you go about changing the timing belts or adjusting 
        their tension? The exact mechanism by which the cartridge spindle is clamped 
        in place and aligned for precision and rigidity is not detailed here. 
        I'm wondering if a split clamp arrangement like what one finds on engine 
        crankshaft bearings wouldn't work. Yet another issue is how the bearings 
        will be protected from swarf and coolant. This is not detailed. One thought 
        I have is whether to feed compressed air to the spindle cartridge. This 
        would have two benefits. First, there is a cooling benefit. Second, it 
        would provide a positive pressure system that would help blow swarf back 
        out of the spindle. Ideally it would be arranged so the air only flows 
        while the motor is running, by using a solenoid valve in the air line. 
        Cosmetics could be greatly improved with judicious chamfering and rounding 
        of edges, and I have not specified fasteners at all. I need to make sure 
        there is the potential for thermal expansion without damaging the bearings. 
        The list goes on. It's a sketch, not a finished design! </p>
      <p class="style1">Materials are pretty straightforward. The spindle cartridge 
        is 3 1/2&quot; OD x 5/8&quot; wall thickness steel DOM tubing. I've checked 
        and it can be machined to the specs desired for the bearings. The rest 
        of the mill head is made from 1&quot; aluminum plate. Ideally one should 
        do a Finite Elements Analysis to optimize and quantify the design. Perhaps 
        someone on one of the web sites will offer to take a 3D model from me 
        and perform that analysis. It is tempting to fill the big chamber behind 
        the spindle cartridge with concrete in order to further dampen any vibration 
        in the head. With all of the aluminum, it seems unlikely this will make 
        the head much heavier than the stock gear drive head. </p>
      <p class="style1">One last thought is that the IH spindle clearly protrudes 
        considerably above the top of the head. This is due to elimination of 
        a quill. It would be my thought to cut this off and fit a shortened drawbar 
        with power changer up there. </p>
      <p class="style1">On the face of it, this does not look like all that difficult 
        a project, although it must be completed with some precision. Here are 
        the sketches:</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Souping Up This Spindle With Duplex AC Bearings </p>
      <p class="style1">Aaron called out 2 bearings to mount the spindle in the 
        IH mill as designed, a 7206 BEP at top and a 7207 BEP at bottom. A duplex 
        pair of 7207's at the bottom would really increase the rigidity of this 
        spindle setup, although not cheaply. It looks like there is enough bearing 
        area on these spindles to accomodate a duplex pair, although I would need 
        to measure it to be sure. One source for such a pair in ABEC 7 accuracy 
        (very good!) is <a href="http://bearingsdirect.com/products/index.php?action=item&id=292&prevaction=category&previd=4&prevstart=25">Bearings 
        Direct, which will sell a matched pair of 7207CTDULP4 for $347.89.</a> 
        This would provide a significant step up in rigidity for this mill. Given 
        that I plan on machining a new head to house the spindle, it would be 
        straightforward to make provision for a duplex pair. It's mighty tempting, 
        I have to say! </p>
      <p class="style1">I was reading another <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10695&page=6">thread 
        on spindle design on CNCZone</a> and Mike Aber opined that having looked 
        at 3 different Asian mills, they were all using deep groove ball bearings 
        and not angular contact bearings. He chose to use that as an excuse to 
        save the cost of the expensive AC bearings. I choose to look at it as 
        reason to believe the performance with a nice set of bearings could be 
        a lot better than the old mill head. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">New #30 Taper Mill Spindle Came Today!</p>
      <p class="style1">I got the spindle from Industrial Hobbies and the bearings 
        from McMaster-Carr. Nice combo. The finish on the spindle is nicer than 
        what IH pictures on their web site. Now I'm champing at the bit to turn 
        it into a mill head! Just have to wait until I finish my other projects 
        though. I need to research carefully how the bearings needed to be fitted 
        to both the spindle and the bores in the mill head I will fabricate. The 
        bearings are SKF's, a 7206 and 7207 angular contacts. Their specs indicate 
        a pretty high speed is possible, so hopefully my goal of 6000-8000 rpm 
        will be doable. I should think so in this application which is pretty 
        lightweight. </p>
      <p class="style1">Building the mill head will largely be a matter of fabricating 
        a box. I need to build a box that will properly house the spindle, bolt 
        to the existing dovetail assembly that the current head bolts to, and 
        that will be nice and rigid. I'm thinking of making it out of some pretty 
        substantial aluminum, perhaps some 1&quot; thick stock or even thicker 
        at top and bottom. I'm thinking of aluminum because it doesn't have the 
        problem of internal stresses moving it after it is machined, so it will 
        stay true. While I'm at it, I think I'll set up this head so it gets trammed 
        in once, and then stays put. There's no need to have a swivel head on 
        a CNC machine, as well as no need for a quill which just reduces the accuracy 
        and rigidity of the head anyway. </p>
      <p class="style1">By taking this approach, I also avoid having to turn down 
        the shaft of my larger motor to fit the IH gearhead. I can just specify 
        a pulley for the timing belt that fits the motor as is. </p>

      <p class="style1"><a href="http://www.industrialhobbies.com/">Industrial

        Mill</a>. At $65, how could I resist? This is a better spindle taper than 
        the classic Bridgeport R8, and is really the preferred taper for building 
        a toolchanger for this mill. Aaron also recommended a set of angular contact 
        bearings from McMaster-Carr that cost another $100, so I ordered those 
        too. What I'd really like to do is take these goodies and create a belt 
        driven head for my mill that's capable of higher rpm's than the current 
        geared head. The more rpm's the merrier so far as I am concerned. I can 
        always use a VFD to cut down on the rpm's if need be.</p>
