      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3/30/06</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: 
        Whoa! Long time no blog! Progress has not been as slow as this would seem 
        to imply, but it hasn't exactly been rapid either. I got one version of 
        the cross slide motor mount completed. It's not quite right, so I'll need 
        to machine a second part. The piece works something like this:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/9x30LeadscrewMeas/CNCCrossSlideGhost.jpg" width="1024" height="604"></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's the shaft adapter that 
        I am having to machine over again. Actually, I will probably just make 
        a spacer. Currently, it did not come out quite long enough to properly 
        capture the bearing. You can see what's going on a little better if I 
        take away the motor bracket itself:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/9x30LeadscrewMeas/CNCCrossSlideSansMotorBracket.jpg" width="1024" height="605"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beyond making the spacer, I 
        need to bore the coupler for a slightly larger than 1/4&quot; shaft on 
        the lathe side and I need to track down a longer metric allen head bolt. 
        Actually, not all that much left to do.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In news on another front, I 
        laid out my chassis that will contain the DC power supply and Gecko's. 
        The second chassis is intended to contain the PC electronics. I want to 
        keep them apart so the noise from the steppers doesn't glitch the computer. 
        I still have some more lay out to do on the PC chassis, plus I need to 
        decide what to do about the PC breakout interface. As I mention immediately 
        below, my game plan had been to use the new GRex from GeckoDrive. That 
        last post was over a month ago and so far as I can see, the GRex is not 
        all that much closer to being a reality with the Mach software. Art had 
        been saying he wanted to be done end of March, but we're now talking end 
        of April. Maybe. For mills only, lathes to follow. There are notes that 
        say things like backlash compensation is a month away, so I'm not too 
        sure what state of &quot;doneness&quot; I can expect in a month. Meanwhile, 
        the Gecko site will only sell you a GRex if you call them up, which gives 
        the distinct impression they view it as a prototype as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think the bottom line is 
        that it'll probably be July before the thing is ready for prime time. 
        Based on that, I'm back to thinking I need a ModIO board and a keyboard 
        emulator board to go with the Campbell parallel board I already have. 
        I hope I'll be able to use GRex when I get ready to CNC my IH Mill.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of the mill, I've 
        been admiring Tormach's new stand for their mills. It really looks sharp 
        and seems like it has a good plan for coolant control. Based on that, 
        plus the fact that a pal of mine knows a great sheet metal guy, I drew 
        up some plans to make something similar for my IH Mill:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/IHMillStand/StandPersp1.jpg" width="1024" height="644"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm envisioning 
        creating a welded base underneath using some 1/4&quot; steel plate and 
        square steel tubing. Eventually I will also build a splash box around 
        the table, again, like the Tormach arrangement. I think these two will 
        handle flood coolant just fine and will give the mill a more professional 
        appearance. I'll get the sheet metal guy to make up the drip pan and splash 
        gaurd and I'll weld together the lower base. Speaking of welding, I have 
        been needing a project at home anyway. I've got my 220V circuits installed 
        at last and it's time to play with my Tig Welder, Plasma Cutter, and soon 
        to be arriving Mig Welder (yep, another deal I couldn't pass up came along, 
        sigh...):</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2/20/06</b>: My brother 
        came over again today and we had another big blast of progress. Things 
        always go a lot faster with him in the shop. He keeps me from wasting 
        too much time I guess. We finished mounting a stepper to the Z-axis (leadscrew):</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/P2203137.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While I was futzing 
        around down in the shop I set up my dial indicator and measured the cross 
        slide backlash. It was 0.0015&quot;, which I took to be pretty darned 
        good for a Chinese lathe. My initial plan for CNC is to skip the ballscrews 
        and see how it goes, so we'll see how bad that backlash turns out to be.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I write this 
        I'm waiting for the GeckoDrive site to start working again so I can order 
        a GRex. That single component will make wiring up my control panel straightforward. 
        It replaces a parallel combo breakout board from Campbell Designs, a Hohman 
        ModIO, and an iPac keyboard emulator. It will do all of that for less 
        money as well as being better integrated and more compact. The only downside 
        is they're still debugging Mach IV for the GRex, but Art assures me on 
        the sight that this is 3 or 4 months at most. At the rate I'm moving, 
        I don't see that as a problem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2/19/06</b>: My brother 
        David and I laid out and mounted controls on the control panel today.

        brand new copy of OneCNC Lathe Express and Mill Advantage today. Oh my 
        gosh I have not seen such slick software in quite a while, and I am in 
        the software business so I know! First, the visual quality of the thing 
        is just incredibly plush. It's just filled with delightful eye candy in 
        the user interface. Second, the commands are laid out in a very simple 
        and well thought out way. I did the simple tutorial for the lathe software 
        and it was completely mind boggling. The potential there is just amazing. 
        With that said, the complexity is also very very high. This is not the 
        fault of OneCNC. On the contrary, I think they have tremendously simplified 
        what is just an extremely difficult area, which is defining toolpaths 
        for CNC machine tools. It's just that I personally have got a whole lot 
        to learn before that stuff becomes second nature to me. </font></p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b><a href="http://www.mooretool.com/">Foundations

        by Connely</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both are very hard to find 
        and expensive, but they contain the gold on this topic. The Connely book 
        is considered THE tome on scraping, while Moore's book was written by 
        the founder of Moore tools and concerns the creation of machine tools 
        accurate to the millionths of an inch. Both are also very expensive if 
        you can find them at all.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They come assembled 
        and will work fine with the capacitors I got on eBay. This will make for 
        a more compact installation in my cabinet as well as cleaning up some 
        point-to-point wiring I would have to make for the power supply. At $29 
        apiece, they seemed a good deal. Tormach has a similar card that adds 
        fuses but does not bolt to the capacitor and they want $79 for theirs, 
        so I thought this one was a decent deal.</font></p>

        one of these days as well as <a href="http://www.thewarfields.com/HotRodBlogIntro.htm">hot rods</a>, 
        and I had been thinking about some kind of an A-Frame to help lift heavy

        that is portable and can be knocked down. Check it out:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supposedly this 
        guy's company paid $3500 each for several of these frames. They're custom 
        welded up and made of aluminum so they're easier to move around. The outside 
        tube dia 3.5" The inside tube dia 3" Both 1/4" thick. 55" tall plus the 
        6" tall head that holds the I beam, with 6" hole spacing for adjustment. 
        The base is 3" angle 36" long Each leg weighs 39# The I beam is 3X5" structural 
        aluminum 10' long but they also have 6, 10, and 15' lengths. It will go 
        over 9' tall but I would not trust it with much weight at that height. 
        That mill has to weigh well over 1000 lbs. One fellow commented that you 
        can buy the adjustable supports at a building supply to use as house supports. 
        A lot of good information is available from <a href="http://www.bushman.com/prod_gcran_broch.asp">Bushman

        Lest ye think I'm ignoring the CNC lathe project, I also found time today 
        to assemble some custom buttons for the lathe's control panel. They're

        thread on the Home Shop Machinist board about setting tool heights for 
        lathes that has pictures of some of the homemade tools these folks

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2/4/06</b>: I got a bunch 
        more goodies in the mail today. OneCNC arrived--hooray! I need to install 
        it and play a bit over the weekend. The packaging is a bit anti-climactic 
        given the cost, but this is normal for software. My firm, Callidus, sells 
        software that costs millions of dollars and it doesn't come in a solid 
        gold presentation case! I also received my second set of step motors. 
        These are NEMA 23's but with 400 oz in. They were brand new motors manufactured 
        for MiniTech mills (a very good brand) and cost $50 apiece. I may use 
        one on the leadscrew if I decide the original motors aren't strong enough. 
        Anyway, they were about the strongest NEMA 23's I had yet seen so I figured 
        I'd latch onto them. I also got my Micronor MPG's from Rogers Machine. 
        Boy are these things sweet! Silky smooth feel of Swiss-made precision. 
        I'm so glad I splurged on these rather than trying to make an MPG from 
        an encoder. There's other odds and ends floating around, but I'm still 
        not quite complete. My order for pushbuttons from Happ Controls wound 
        up on backorder-DOH! I also have a lengthy &quot;Honey-Do&quot; list for 
        the weekend. I'm hoping to blast through it and maybe start to mount components 
        in the NEMA enclosure. </font></p>

        Rhino 3D tutorials (still haven't received the &quot;official&quot; version 
        I bought cheap, so I am conserving my 25 saves). The tutorials for the 
        program are very good, and I am enjoying using it more and more. I can 
        see why people really like Rhino as it is easy to use and understand. 
        The basic concepts behind solid modelling are a little arcane, but that 
        isn't Rhino's fault and the tutorials do a good job of showing you a lot 
        of that. </font></p>

        about some novel uses for lasers in the workshop. I mentioned below the 
        ScanZ program. Another simpler application uses a device 
        sold by Sears called a &quot;LaserTrac&quot; to project a crosshairs on 
        your mill table or drill press showing exactly where the spindle is centered. 
        I need to rig up one of those as well as investigate their use when centering 
        work in a 4-jaw lathe chuck! Only problem is that the consensus seems 
        to be the device is not very precision oriented. </font></p>

        about a device for measuring the accuracy of CNC machines and calibrating 
        their compensation called a &quot;Renishaw Ballbar.&quot; The thing is 
        fabulously expensive, but it has got me wondering what amateurs can do 
        to achieve our equivalent result. My thought is that there should be something 
        similar to the test videos used by home theater enthusiasts. Imagine a 
        &quot;reference g-code program&quot;. You run it on your CNC machine and 
        out pops a part. You then measure various points on the part with your 
        micrometers and what not to learn what's &quot;off&quot; on your machine. 
        Presumably you could measure all kinds of things with such a standardized

        those. His email to me was dated 4am, so I don't know when he sleeps! 
        Numerous other folks have responded to my cold email inquiries about this

        cheap on eBay, they look easy to assemble (compared to special crimpers 
        and stuff needed for amp), and they are weatherproof (hence hopefully 
        coolant proof!). They're heavy duty rubber coated connectors used for 
        professional music applications like rock concerts. I got some panel mount 
        female connectors and a pair of 5' 14 AWG 4 conductor cables, which should 
        be perfect for my two lathe axes. I also got my combo breakout board and 
        Gecko drives in the mail today. Boy those Gecko's sure are slick! It's 
        no wonder they're doing a business. Lastly, I ordered the components for 
        a Micro-ATX form factor PC from NewEgg. I got an Asus K8V-MX motherboard,

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1/22/06</b>: Today I'm trying 
        to understand the trade-offs between ground and rolled ballscrews. Of 
        course some folks will tell you there is no comparison, go for the ground. 
        Others seem to feel that with leadscrew compensation (which Mach has), 
        rolled ballscrews are fine. The issue also seems to be linked to usage. 
        I have the impression that a mill doing detailed 3D profiles (e.g. carving 
        really intricate stuff) has to have ground ballscrews whereas my lathe 
        may not benefit. On the lathe there is no analog to the complex 3D milling 
        chore, and direction seldom reverses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If using rolled ballnuts, many 
        recommend a double ballnut with preload (wavy washer) between the nuts.

        control panel for fast slewing. It has 4 microswitches which I will set 
        up for the Mach 3 Shift+Arrow fast jog commands. Second is a set of 3 
        Kerk anti-backlash leadscrews. These are small and were very cheap at 
        $9 apiece. I really wanted to just see and potentially experiment with 
        them. If they look like the real deal I may use one for the cross slide 
        in my lathe to reduce the backlash. The sure are smooth and low friction 
        just playing with them by hand! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also ordered a pair of Gecko 
        drives today and a Combo breakout board from Campbell designs. I ordered 
        the Gecko 202's because they have short circuit protection and are said 
        to be more &quot;beginner proofed.&quot; Lastly, I ordered a new motor 
        for my mill, the Leeson 2-1.5hp-kw 3425rpm #192074 that Industrial Hobbies 
        recommends. I have a line on a Variable Frequency Drive for it as well,

        if I am not using the Mach Wizards or writing g-code by hand, what software 
        would I use to develop the g-codes? It seems that the mill world is much 
        better served than lathes. I did manage to find some software, the trick 
        will be balancing function and cost. Here are some notes and thoughts:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MasterCAM Lathe: Looks really 
        slick. Available cheap to students but you have to be enrolled in an accredited 
        program and the license times out in 9 months. Looks really painful for 
        the rest of us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vector CAD/CAM: Claimed to 
        do lathe, but their site links don't work for lathe. Can be had cheap. 
        Not much info available.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ACE: Shareware that will convert 
        lines and arcs in a DXF file to a toolpath. Sounds like it works great 
        for milling. Not sure if it could be used for cutting profiles or not.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SurfCAM Lathe: Very cool looking 
        package with 3D modelling and profiling. You have to purchase software 
        maintenance. Given this and the fact that nobody quotes prices, you have 
        to contact their dealers, fight through sales people, yada, yada, I would 
        assume it is expensive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EZCAM EZTurn-Express: $995 
        (at least they'll quote a price!). You can get a combo deal with EZMill 
        for $1495. Looks pretty comprehensive, but not cheap!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://shopcam.com/index.php">ShopCAM</a>: 
        $795 to $995. It looks pretty nice. Definitely a step up from Kipware.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CAMSoft: $1995</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.onecnc.net/index.htm">OneCNC</a>: 
        $???. Rumor has it the program is $1500, which is Visual Mill territory. 
        Waiting on a price quote. This one seems really highly regarded and could 
        be the best of the lot. It sure looks impressive. It's probably too much! 
        Many have said it beats MasterCAM and VisualMill (yep, I know VisualMill 
        isn't for lathes!). Everyone raves about OneCNC.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.turbocad.com/index.asp">TurboCadCam</a>: 
        $995. Not bad! I need to do more research. It works with Mach and supports 
        lathes. Full version of TurboCAD included. Could be this kills many birds 
        with one stone. Some users report a steep learning curve, but every question 
        I read on CNCZone the guy eventually got help and got it to work. There 
        does seem to be a suspicion that OneCNC is an upgrade from it, however.</font></p>

        I did a ton of reading. I'm pretty convinced I want the <a href="http://www.campbelldesigns.com/Combo-board.php">Campbell

        (i.e. USB) or use a second parallel port. I'm likely to take the USB route 
        as I believe this is what Art, Mach's chief developer, is using. Lastly, 
        I note that the <a href="http://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html">IPAC</a> 
        is a really slick device to allow you to take up to 56 additional button 
        inputs and convert them to virtual keyboard presses. I think that for 
        example this is a way to use a 4 position arcade joystick to deliver rapid 
        slewing as well as a number of other functions. <a href="http://www.xgaming.com/arcade_joystick.shtml">X-Arcade</a>

        preliminary plans for <a href="MTLatheSteppers.htm">how to mount the steppers 
        to the shafts</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>12/26/05:</b> One of the 
        great difficulties in performing manual machining on a CNC-converted machine 
        is ball screws are not suitable for manual work. They have so little friction 
        that they will not hold their positions without a powered up stepper or 
        servo to keep them locked in place. Some machinists have fashioned friction 
        locks to try to compensate, but there is another alternative: high performance 
        leadscrews made by <a href="http://www.kerkmotion.com/">Kerk</a>. Another 
        alternative are these anti-backlash nuts from <a href="http://gonebowlin.com/dumpsterCNC/">Dumpster 
        CNC</a>. Once you start looking for these nuts there seem to be a lot 
        of them around. Their <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/%7Ekontkant/index.php.html">makers 
        swear by them</a> and measured backlash seems to be light. This is not 
        the conventional wisdom, but I like to understand all of the alternatives. 
        One thing I notice is that for a mill's Z-axis, the thinking seems to 
        be that a nice leadscrew works well enough because all the weight of the 
        head cancels out the backlash. That's a good things for me because my 
        <a href="CCMillHome.html">Industrial Hobbies mill</a> head weighs 200 lbs 
        and has so much travel that a ballscrew would be very expensive for it! 
        Even so that's a lot of weight so probably a counterweight will be in 
        order when I get ready to CNC the mill.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also went down and partially 
        disassembled the lathe to <a href="MTLatheSteppers.htm">measure the shafts 
        for couplers</a>. McMaster Carr has helical beam couplers that will work 
        out well for the project.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>12/25/06</b>: I came across 
        some new products from a company called <a href="http://www.pmdx.com/">PMDX</a> 
        that look really well done today. These guys make several intriguing products, 
        but I especially liked their PMDX-135 Power Preparation Module and PMDX-131 
        Breakout/Motherboard. The PMDX-135 Power Preparation Module is basically 
        everything you need for the step motor (or servo motor) power supply except 
        the transformer. This even includes the recommended fuses. The board is 
        compact, assembled, and even includes circuits to drain back EMF. The 
        boards are $119, which is more than you'd pay to just slap together a 
        bridge rectifier and capacitors, but this device sure is slick. The PMDX-131 
        Breakout/Motherboard is even niftier. It is designed so that the Gecko 
        drives attach to it directly. They would be bolted down for heatsink purposes 
        and this think hovers directly above with a direct connection to their 
        appropriate leads built right in. No hand wiring to the Geckos, shortest 
        possible wiring runs, again, very slick design. I think these little boards 
        would really streamline the stepper infrastructure piece and leave a lot 
        more room to manuever in the NEMA enclosure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second thing I've gotten 
        interested in is Micro-ATX form factor PC's. These little boards are available 
        very cheaply from NewEgg (they had one for under $40!). They have a parallel 
        port and all the other usual connections, plus they accept a couple of 
        PCI cards should expansion (i.e. for a second parallel port to deal with 
        that Rogers encoder board!) be needed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>12/23/05</b>: As I write 
        this the other members of the <b><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/e-leadscrew/">Yahoo 
        E-Leadscrew Group</a></b> have really got up a head of steam. John D. 
        is able to synchronize a stepper to a dc motor simulated spindle, and 
        change the ratios in the software to simulate driving a leadscrew for 
        particular threads. Paul Kelly has shown a couple photos of his &quot;2 
        knobs and a button&quot; design for an ELS that look quite intriguing. 
        I am hopeful we will be ready to pass from prototype to figuring out producting 
        sometime in the next month or so. Meanwhile, since there are so many variables 
        at the controller end, I have been focusing on doing research about CNC 
        (especially conversational CNC) and on setting to work to create the <a href="MTLatheSteppers.htm"><b>power 
        supply and other stepper infrastructure</b></a> that will be needed in 
        any case. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have ordered a good set of 
        basic parts to begin the power supply, having found a nice toroidal transformer 
        (recommended by Bob Campbell in some board or other), bridge rectifier, 
        and large filter caps. With help from Dave Mucha on the E-Leadscrew board, 
        I think I now understand the power requirements of my step motors much 
        better. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While waiting for these simple 
        parts to arrive, I'm starting to think about how I want to do the enclosure. 
        A lot of the very professional looking CNC conversions are using NEMA-style 
        enclosures. They <a href="http://www.iandalziel.co.uk/cncmill.htm"><b>look 
        right at home next to a machine</b></a> and have dust sealing features 
        and so forth. I would mount the power supply, Gecko drives, breakout board, 
        and probably a few other odds and ends in the enclosure. I will probably 
        order one of these pretty shortly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the CNC research front, 
        I have become captivated with the idea of Manual Pulse Generators (handwheels 
        connected to encoders and abbreviated &quot;MPG&quot;) after reading a 
        discussion of how easy they are to create on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CAD_CAM_EDM_DRO/messages">Yahoo 
        CAD CAM EDM DRO</a> board. It very simply to generate step and direction 
        pulses from an encoder using a single chip. Pick up a cheap rotary encoder 
        ($19) from US Digital, connect to a chip they sell (LS7184, $3.05), and 
        you've got the step and direction. If the encoder resolution is the same 
        as your step motor's (e.g. 200 per rev in my case), you have a nice 1:1 
        match between the two and the ratio will feel identical to a directly 
        connected manual handwheel. Another fellow points out that you can even 
        direct connect to the encoder for even simpler step/direction: </font></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually, an encoder 
        is already step/direction, as long as you don't spin it too fast (which 
        you can't by hand ;) ) Just connect phase A to the direction input, and 
        phase B to the step input. If it runs backwards, switch the two wires. 
        Here's why it works. This is the pattern of phase signals from an encoder 
        (note that they always specify whether it's for clockwise or counterclockwise 
        rotation in the datashets): A B 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 The stepper drive will 
        only be looking for one edge of the step signal - let's pick the negative-going 
        edge. If you apply the sequence above (dir=A, step=B) to the drive, then 
        it'll see a 1 on DIR when the negative step edge appears. If you spin 
        it backwards, you get the reverse sequence: A B 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 Now, every 
        time the step pulse goes to 0, there's a 0 on the DIR pin. The disadvantage 
        is that you get only one pulse per full cycle - there's no "resolution 
        multiplication" that we're used to. Oh - and the speed limit is due to 
        changing the direction line during a step. With 1000 CPR encoders, you'd 
        have to spin it at about 12000 RPM to have a problem ;) </font></blockquote>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I dug around and found a <a href="http://www.centroidcnc.com/cncvideo/videolathempg.html">video 
        of a Centroid CNC lathe</a> with dual handwheels. I like the idea of the 
        center joystick for fast traverse, and the natural mounting position. 
        On Hardinge lathe conversions they keep the handwheels in the stock position 
        but connected to encoders and not the leadscrews. The operator certainly 
        looked very natural using them. BTW, there is a <a href="http://www.centroidcnc.com/cncvideo/videot400picpart.html">video 
        of the lathe making a part</a> that is very cool as well. I found a number

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While digging around through 
        all of this I found an <a href="http://www.woodworkingathome.com/CNC/CNCLatheController.htm">amazing 
        article on an extremely intricate custom CNC control panel</a> an amateur 
        has made. It is a very ambitious project and he hasn't even bought the 
        machine yet! Nevertheless, it has been inspirational to see what is possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After looking through all of 
        this, it seems clear I need yet another page to organize thoughts about 
        CNC control. There just isn't enough time in the day!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The list bit of CNC investigation 
        I have been wondering about is the whole issue of backlash and closed 
        loop control. Just adding an encoder to the steppers is a pretty weak 
        excuse for closed loop. It will detect missed steps, but it will have 
        nothing to say about backlash, which can be a serious issue in CNC applications. 
        It is so serious that most CNC'ers lust after expensive ground ballscrews 
        because they don't have much backlash. There are three problems with the 
        ballscrew approach. First, they are expensive. That has not stopped me 
        before, so let's keep talking. Second, once you convert to ballscrews, 
        all hope of manual handwheel operation is gone except for MPG's. There 
        is simply not enough friction left in the system and the tool will push 
        back on the ballscrews and move them. Doh! Lastly, and this is the most 
        difficult obstacle, it is very hard to find room for ballscrews on the 
        lathe, especially the cross slide. By their nature, ballscrews are pretty 
        bulky. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My thought is that if I can 
        use some DRO-style glass scales, these would give the faithful position 
        information regardless of ballscrews. There are some mysteries about this. 
        First, while I have found articles that suggest Mach can read DRO scales, 
        they have little to say about the impact on dealing with backlash. I need 
        to understand better what happens here, and may simply have to contact 
        the creators or post on their board to see the result. Second, interfacing 
        the scales is not so straightforward. There is a special board by <a href="http://www.rogersmachine.net/index.html">Rogers 
        Machine</a> that claims to do it and connect via a second parallel port. 
        Turns out that board is built by the same guy that builds Campbell Designs 
        popular breakout board, which is intriguing. Need to do more research 
        on this! I posted a question to the Mach support group. I also need to 
        decide what to do about my Shumatech DRO. If I can really connect the 
        DRO scales to Mach and benefit, I think I'll go ahead and build the DRO 
        and get it all connected. I can always sell it to someone if I move up 
        to Mach.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Somewhere in the midst of all 
        this I found an inexpensive 12&quot; ELO LCD touch panel on eBay and bought 
        it. The thing is supposed to be liquid-proof, which seemed like a good 
        idea for a machine tool application. Sniffing around the Mach Wikipedia, 
        there is an article on <a href="http://www.machsupport.com/MachCustomizeWiki/index.php?title=Touch_Screen_and_panel_controls_using_ModIO">hooking 
        up touchscreens to Mach</a>. They mention an <a href="http://www.virtual-keyboard.com/">onscreen 
        keyboard software product</a> which might also be useful to know about 
        for various purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another thing I notice in all 
        of this is that the guys with MPG's also want an analog spindle speed 
        override. Presumably this lets them deal with chatter and so forth in 
        real time. It looks to me like their setups toggle in an optional trim 
        pot that centers around the value driven by the CNC software. It is mentioned 
        that while this could also be done in software, its nice that the knob 
        &quot;remembers&quot; its position</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I found an awesome page that 
        details <a href="http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/parallel_output.html">how 
        to use your parallel port to &quot;talk&quot; to things</a>. This is the 
        standard way all the CNC stuff connects using breakout boards.</font></p>
