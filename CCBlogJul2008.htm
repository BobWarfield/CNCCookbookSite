        Epoxy Granite Filling Around the Column Bolt Pipe on My IH Mill</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just to make sure 
        I was revved up to go to work on the mill this morning I watched a bunch 
        of <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34145">CNC 
        videos on CNCZone</a>. Then I went down, donned my nitrile gloves, and 
        got back to making my epoxy granite mud pies:</font> </p>

      <p  align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I filled up 
        to about 1/2&quot; from the top of the pipe, and then I switched to a

        up...</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle"> Started 
        Some Pages for Bobs No.1 Steam Engine</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will be a 
        very long term project but I started some pages to keep track of it on. 
        Biggest news here is <a href="CCBobsNo1SteamPort.htm">I've changed the 
        steam port design</a> based on a clever suggestion someone made to me.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle"> Still More 
        Epoxy Granite Pouring, But No Pix</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I filled most 
        of the base up to about 1/2&quot; below the top of the pipe for the central 
        column bolt. I want to let that set up and then carefully take the mixture 
        the last little bit to the top of pipe. The reason is that its real tight 
        confines inside the column and I wanted to do the last little bit with 
        a mixture that's wetter and more sand with less gravel.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Some 
        Steam Engine 3D Modeling</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been slowly 
        working on a Rhino 3D model of a steam engine similar to a Stuart Turner 
        No.1. I was inspired by <a href="http://modelengines.info/goldeng/">the 
        Engineman's (John Bentley's) naval brass version</a> of the same steam 
        engine. Here are a couple screen shots to show how far I've gotten:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/SteamEngines/BobsNo1/PerspectiveJul13%20copy.jpg" width="606" height="1024"><img src="img/SteamEngines/BobsNo1/RightJul13.jpg" width="627" height="1024"></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's good fun 
        doing these 3D models, and I sure am learning a lot about how a slide 
        valve steam engine works! When I get all done I can scale the model to 
        just about any size. If I like it well enough maybe I'll CNC one up down 
        the road. It certainly would be challenging given some of the parts.</font></p>
      <p class="BlogDate">7/5/08</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle"> Preparing 
        for the Column Pour on My CNC Mill Conversion</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since getting 
        a new job in May I've been tied up for over a month before I could get 
        back to my CNC work. I also had to finish up my little <a href="CCRevOpenCol.htm">steam 
        engine team build</a>. I was able to carve out a little time over this 
        Fourth of July three day weekend to make slight progress. I've basically 
        epoxied a base plate into the bottom of the column along with a pipe that 
        provides a bore for the big column bolt to go through:</font></p>
      <p  align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010790.JPG" width="1024" height="709"></font></p>
      <p  align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The surface tension 
        works nicely to let me apply a fair amount of epoxy. I just want enough 
        to hold the pipe solidly so that when I flip the column over start adding 
        the E/G mixture from above it won't break loose. I'll let this cure all 
        week and then hopefully tackle the column fill next weekend. I've decided 
        not to fill the column all the way up. This arrangement will fill the 
        bottom 10&quot; or so and should add considerable dampening without in 
        any way being a clearance problem. I would think this will really help 
        the mill to perform better to have this much added dampening mass in the 
        critical junction between the base and the column. More would be better, 
        but I'm anxious to get on with the rest of the CNC conversion and there 
        is a lot of work to do!</font></p>
      <p class="BlogDate">7/4/08</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle"> Indicating 
        a 5C collet setup true</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A company called 
        Landis makes these 5C nosepieces that can be indicated true. Evidently 
        they're intended for grinding but I can't see why the idea wouldn't work 
        well for a lathe too:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/5CAdjustTrue.jpg" width="288" height="192"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/5CAdjustTrue2.jpg" width="288" height="192"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you can see, 
        there is a 5c nosepiece that rides in the collar. The collar has 4 set 
        screws to adjust the nosepiece until the runout is zero. The drawbar holds 
        everything in position, and the set screws ride in a groove on the nosepiece 
        so nothing can fly loose. Seems like a neat setup that would not be hard 
        for a machinist to build. I got an air collet closer off eBay, and I will 
        be tempted to make one of these to go with it.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle"> Bob's No. 
        1 Has a Con Rod Interference Problem</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was taking another 
        gander at the magnificent photos on <a href="http://modelengines.info/goldeng/index.html">John 
        Bentley's (The Engine Man) site</a> when I decided to have a go at modeling 
        a similar steam engine. Bentley's engine is loosely based on Stuart Turner's 
        No. 1, so I thought i&quot;d call this design exercise &quot;Bob's No. 
        1&quot; as well. It's amazing how much time you can spend on one of these 
        and how neat they turn out. I got this far after about 2 hours:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I reckon this 
        one will take a solid 12-15 hours to really finish. When I'm all done, 
        I hope some day to make one of these via CNC.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand the 
        first 2, but not sure about the 3rd. I would think it would be pretty 
        easy to trick a CAM program capable of gang tooling into dealing with 
        this arrangement. A bigger problem I would think is the need to load each 
        part blank individually before turning it. Even a pretty simple CNC arrangement 
        can feed the work through the spindle pretty easily. Still, if you just 
        need to make a few short pieces, this would be a fast way to do it. I 
        think I would add some means of registering the gang plate to the vise 
        repeatably.</font></p>

        the tool to the spindle (with the spindle switched off, of course!), and 
        go at it that way. It seems expensive and awkward to me compared to something 
        as simple as this. The advantage of the duality I could see would be tailstock 
        support and the potential to feed material through the spindle. On the 
        negative side you have to manhandle the heavy little sucker onto your 
        table, get it aligned so it is &quot;trammed&quot; to the table, and you're 
        going to be swapping tools for every operation. I just can't see spending 
        the kind of money they want for that &quot;solution&quot; when you've

        Indexing Feedback: Thanks!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My spindle indexing 
        note below seems to have really gotten the juices flowing for a number 
        of readers.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, thanks 
        go to Peter Tsukamoto of PT Engineering (my dream--a machine shop in Hawaii). 
        While I've been thinking of C-axis ideas off and on for some time, Peter 
        rekindled that interest with a series of notes. He re-raised the disc 
        brake idea, which got me looking for the thread I'd seen in CNCZone again 
        so I could share it with him. We've had a lively back and forth about 
        the virtues of my two motor idea versus just biting the bullet and putting 
        <a href="http://www.yaskawa.com/site/products.nsf/ProductDetailPages/Spindle%20Drives%20and%20Motors%7EDual%20Winding%20Motor%7EDualWindingMotorRatingsandSpecifications.html">a 
        real servo drive </a>in place of a spindle motor. Peter does some cool 
        work, retrofits machines, and has built some really neat capabilities 
        into some of his machines. See for example his YouTube video of his Accuslide 
        lathe cranking out parts:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><object width="425" height="355">

        </object></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peter points out that you can 
        buy brake lining material, cut generic square pads that are easily replaced, 
        and machine your own caliper very quickly off a CNC mill. Another great 
        one from Peter is an idea to converted a 3-phase motor so it is &quot;vector 
        rated&quot;. Vector rating let's you run the motor over a broader range 
        without overheating. He suggests the main thing to do is control winding 
        temperature. Start with an ODP open drip proof motor and machine an end 
        frame to hold a high perf fan with temp sensor. This will keep it cool 
        when needed and throttle air flow down when cold to reduce dust build 
        up. If you run too fast (you can &quot;overclock&quot; with VFD and vector 
        drives by increasing frequency to more than 60 Hz) the motor can overheat, 
        and especially the spindle bearings, and if you run too slow there isn't 
        enough airflow from the shaft fan. An electric fan with sensor means the 
        fan isn't limited to shaft speed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, Cor van der Jagt from 
        the firm idaps.nl in the Netherlands wrote about an idea to isolate the 
        motors in a 2 motor situation. He suggests using a differential to decouple 
        the motors:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Machines/IndexDiff.jpg" width="483" height="403"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, Rus Crespo 
        suggests mid-80's GM front wheel drive vehicles for brake calipers. He 
        says he found a reman caliper for an 87 Chevy Celebrity for $18 and a 
        new rotor for $12. You can hardly buy cast iron for that! The Gm calipers 
        are a floating design, so there is only one piston and the caliiper floats 
        relative to the rotor, so you have to use sliding caliper bolts to secure 
        it. He goes on to suggest disc brakes from riding mowers if you need an 
        even smaller size, or perhaps for g-karts.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only other 
        thought I've had is I'd be tempted to go with an aluminum rotor. It's 
        not going to get the wear a real vehicle brake gets (at least not in my 
        shiop!), and it would be a lot lighter. I machined an aluminum disc that 
        came out very nicely for <a href="CCDiscSander.htm">my 12&quot; disc sander 
        </a>and it spins very well at 3400 rpm.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are all 
        great suggestions guys, thanks for chiming in! </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle"> Vector Drive 
        Magic and Indexing the Spindle of a Lathe or Mill</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been keeping 
        an eye on vector drives for a little while now. Essentially, they are 
        a &quot;better VFD&quot; to drive an AC motor with variable speed. Why 
        better? Because they enable a wider speed range without loss of torque. 
        I read a <a href="http://www.reliance.com/pdf/drives/whitepapers/D7161.pdf">white 
        paper by Reliance Electric</a> that indicated you could expect a 2:1 range 
        for a regular VFD, and a 4:1 range with a vector drive. In other words, 
        run your motor at up to half speed without losing torque with a normal 
        VFD, and 1/4 speed with a vector drive. Why does this matter? Because 
        the speed range you need to cover the gamut of machining tough steels 
        all the way up to aluminum and soft materials is huge. To span a range 
        of 100 rpm all the way to 8000 rpm (still nowhere close to what a lot 
        of CNC's run today) takes an 80:1 range!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's why you 
        need gear changes, back gears, step pulleys, variable pitch pulleys, or 
        a host of other mechanical transmissions used on different machine tools. 
        But those transmissions are a hassle to deal with too, especially if you 
        want to build your own machine, or <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">radically 
        alter the performance envelope of you spindle</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it was with 
        some interest that I came across a <a href="http://www.smcyclo.com/products/ac/hf430.shtml">Sumitomo 
        Vector Drive spec</a>. I guess a good vector drive these days has more 
        range than Reliance gives them credit for. A sensorless drive is one you 
        could just hook up like any VFD, and Sumitomo claims a range of 120:1 
        for their HF-430 unit in sensorless mode and that with a speed accuracy 
        of 0.5%. But it gets even better. Add the encoder board and put a suitable 
        encoder on the motor and now they're claiming a range of 1000:1 and speed 
        accuracy of 0.05%! That's starting to be quite a range, and these drives 
        have gotten a lot cheaper over time. I came across this particular one 
        in an eBay buy it now for $249 for a 3 HP unit.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only thing 
        missing from it seems to be true servo operation, or at least a means 
        of parking the spindle at a known location. True servo operation would 
        allow the spindle to be indexed to any arbitrary position. You can imagine 
        that would be handy if you wanted to set up your lathe spindle with a 
        3 HP motor (or more) and treat it as a C-axis. Index to a location, put 
        an air powered spindle on your CNC gang slide, and you can suddenly drill 
        a bolt circle for a flange under CNC power. A parking position would make 
        implementing a tool changer for a mill a lot more feasible. Park the spindle 
        in a known location and the &quot;dogs&quot; on the toolholder are properly 
        lined up.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got thinking 
        about this, searched CNCZone, and didn't see an awful lot of help there. 
        Then I realized I was just making it too hard. Why not just lash up a 
        suitable stepper or servo and use it for the indexing operation? First, 
        I am envisioning a system that does not be able to continuously machine 
        as the axis rotates. It is a pure indexing system that indexes a position, 
        locks the spindle, and then performs the machining task. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, this implies 
        to me a spindle brake. That makes me think of a disc brake, and I've written 
        about that in this blog before. So I envision a rotor with a disk brake 
        caliper to look the assembly. Probably use a motorcycle-sized rotor/caliper 
        to keep the weight from getting too crazy. There's <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=29796">a 
        CNCZone thread</a> where a fella did just that and controls the brake 
        with an air solenoid. I would think if you can find a scrapped bike the 
        disc rotor and caliper would be very cheap to buy. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Machines/break2.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using a disc 
        brake caliper to lock an indexer...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third, how then 
        to index? Again, it seems to me the easiest thing is to arrange a second 
        motor to do the indexing. Seems to me servos are designed to run at the 
        kinds of speeds these spindles turn at. Just bought a nice one from Homeshopcnc 
        that'll do 4500 rpm, for example. So we make sure that we can run one 
        motor or the other BUT NOT BOTH electrically. We freewheel the servo when 
        the spindle motor is going, and freewheel the spindle motor during indexing. 
        Why a servo? Well because we can put the encoder onto the machine's spindle 
        (not the spindle motor!) and let it sense the true motion and soak up 
        any backlash to increase accuracy. There won't be much anyway if we use 
        a toothed belt drive. If you prefer, a decent sized stepper is cheaper 
        still. You'll want to groove the toothed belt else when the spindle motor 
        runs it'll scream like a banshee, but that's easy to do too. So, we need 
        to add a toothed belt pulley to the existing spindle motor pulley stack 
        and drive it with a suitably mounted servo or stepper. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's think about 
        the motor interlock. I would want a failsafe such that their is a contactor 
        or other high reliability way to ensure there is no power available to 
        whichever motor is not in use. I'd probably use an input pin to trigger 
        indexing mode, and another to trigger the spindle brake. Note that we 
        really need to completely cut off the power to the stepper/servo indexer 
        when not using it or it'll try to force the spindle to its desired position 
        causing all sorts of trouble. While we're at it, this should be a tri-state 
        where we have just one of the following modes:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Spindle mode: 
        Give the spindle drive (VFD or Vector) the juice and let it operate the 
        spindle normally. You'll want spindle on/off, forward/reverse, and speed 
        control. The brake and indexer are disabled.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Indexing mode: 
        The spindle and brake are disabled. The Gecko (or whatever drive) to the 
        indexing motor is energized. You can command motion from the C (or whatever 
        axis you set it up as in Mach 3) axis in your g-codes to index. Light 
        machine would be possible without the brake, but probably not recommended. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Brake mode: 
        The spindle and indexing motors are both disabled. A compressed air solenoid 
        energizes the brake, locking the spindle in its current position to allow 
        machining. Note that we may want to slightly overlap the indexing and 
        brake modes to make sure that the indexing motor holds the spindle in 
        the correct position until the brake is fully locked.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'll have to think 
        about how exactly to implement such an interlock, but it sure seems like 
        this does the trick relatively cheaply and easily. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thought this 
        was a clever idea from <a href="http://bbs.homeshopmachinist.net/showthread.php?t=29031&amp;page=2">Evan 
        over on the HSM board</a>. It's a drip oiler for the horizontal bandsaw. 
        When the saw is down and cutting, the nozzle is below the &quot;water 
        line&quot; of the coolant, and dripping proceeds through an adjustment 
        valve. Raise the saw and the nozzle rises above the line so the gravity 
        feed stops. I use my bandsaw primarily in the vertical position these 
        days, so it wouldn't help me, but it might be just the ticket for a little 
        cutting oil to increase your blade life if you use these handy saws for 
        cutting stock to length.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Bought a 
        Set of Servos and Gecko Drives from HomeShopCNC</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After reading 
        a note sent to me by <a href="http://www.ptengineeringllc.com/">Peter 
        Tsukamoto</a>, I got inspired to take a step of some kind on the mill 
        to move this conversion forward. Peter started with a Unimat lathe 30 
        years ago and today he owns a full machine shop in Hawaii. Guys like that 
        are always an inspiration to me, so I try to listen carefully when they 
        have some advice for me. In Peter's words:</font></p>
      <p align="left"> 
      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>See if you can 
        get your CNC mill going as a priority. It will open up new vistas in a 
        way you cannot believe. It will accelerate any project you work on. Make 
        them way more enjoyable too. </b></font></blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He makes a lot 
        of sense there. Every time I perform a manual machining operation on my 
        lathe or mill I think about what the CNC equivalent would be. In almost 
        every case I could do the job much faster, more easily, and often better 
        with CNC. There's a reason it took the industry by storm years ago!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple things 
        have been holding up my progress. First, I've been spending a ton of time 
        lately on a <a href="CCRevOpenCol.htm">Steam Engine Team Build</a> that 
        has involved creating some tooling and a number of other things. The other 
        problem that was distressing me was that I had misplaced the <a href="http://www.industrialhobbies.com/">Industrial 
        Hobbies CNC conversion kit</a> somewhere in my house. I'd been looking 
        for it off and on for days, and the number of places it could be was dwindling. 
        After spending 45 minutes in the garage shifting things around and checking 
        every last possible hiding place underneath all the junk, real panic set 
        in. Paraphrasing Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, when you've eliminated 
        all the possibles, you have to start considering the impossibles. Eventually 
        I discovered that my kids had pressed the two boxes into service to create 
        a stand for their Karaoke machine. They were hidden underneath a black 
        table cloth to make it even harder. I heaved a mighty sigh of relief after 
        making that discovery!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, having located 
        the components, I decided to take another step and ordered up a set of 
        servos and drives from HomeShopCNC. 
        I also looked at <a href="http://www.kelinginc.net/">Keling</a> as another 
        source. HomeShopCNC was just slightly cheaper on Gecko drives, and I liked 
        the nifty anodized housings for the encoders:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Servos/ServoMotor.jpg" width="792" height="537"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I like the nifty 
        anodized housing for the encoder...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are 850 
        oz in servos, and Keling had a bigger model at a whopping 1125 oz in. 
        Why not just buy the bigger-is-better plan? Well, because there are trade 
        offs. It's worth noting that the standard IH CNC kit comes with 410 oz 
        in on the X/Y axes and 648 on the Z--that mill head is heavy! Their heavy 
        duty kit looks to me like is substitutes the bigger Z servo on the X/Y 
        axes. Either way, I should be fine with 850 oz in. Now here is the rub. 
        The big Kelling 1125 oz in servo peaks out at 3200 rpm whereas the 850's 
        I got are spec'd for 4200 rpm. I don't know if I'll ever get to use the 
        extra rpm to increase my rapids or not, but bigger servos are often slower 
        and the same is true of stepper motors. I think these 850's will be a 
        decent compromise and they'll give me some room to experiment on my feeds 
        and speeds. If the Z gives me any trouble I figure I can build a counterweighting 
        system with some gas springs and radically reduce the force needed there 
        too.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While I'm talking 
        about alternatives, I should mention that I did some serious looking around 
        for an alternative to the Gecko drives. Why? Customer Service. That's 
        got to come as a surprise because Gecko has some of the best customer 
        service reputation in the industry. The trouble is, I ran afoul of one 
        of the counter examples of that. My GRex for my <a href="CCLatheCNCHome.htm">CNC 
        lathe project</a> has been a disaster. The good news: it was very easy 
        to get it working, and I like the idea of not relying on the parallel 
        port. In theory, it could save me a lot of trouble, especially since I 
        had envisioned a fancy control panel for it. The reality? The device has 
        never lived up to its original promises. It has had teething troubles 
        since the beginning, and most of it has never gotten fixed. There are 
        problems with 3D profiling on the mill that make it a questionable solution 
        there, and the device doesn't support spindle indexing on the lathe, which 
        is a requirement for threading. What good is a lathe that can't thread? 
        Many promises were made over time about this being fixed, and we're talking 
        a span of years. Unfortunately, it has never panned out. Gecko blames 
        it on the firmware and says it isn't their fault. I think that's silly, 
        and it certainly was not the story at the outset. I sent Mariss a note 
        offering to trade my perfectly good GRex for a set of 3 of his cheapest 
        servo drives (which combined were less than the GRex cost), and explained 
        my problem with the GRex. I never even got a response back from Gecko. 
        That's just not good customer service in my book, despite their stellar 
        reputation.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So how did I wind 
        up buying another set of Gecko drives anyway? Here's the rub--who else 
        is there? Rutex is in an odd state. The parent is Australian, and the 
        designer has gone missing there last I heard. Reports vary on whether 
        the boards can be gotten here though the US distributor says yes. Last 
        thing I want to deal with is another strange situation with one of these 
        boards though the Rutex has a lot of advantages over the Geckos on paper, 
        and there are certainly those who swear by them. I also looked at the 
        <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=14217&amp;highlight=uhu+servo+drive+kit">UHU 
        family of servo drives</a>. These look to be excellent, but so far they 
        are either awfully expensive if you buy one already built, or you deal 
        with cobbling together a kit. Frankly, I was tempted to go the kit route 
        anyway, just to avoid Gecko. I enjoy building electronics and I'm pretty 
        good at it. The trouble is, Peter's words kept nagging at me. How much 
        would it set back my conversion to have to build and debug 3 servo controller 
        boards? So I got the Geckos. They were cheap when bought with the servos 
        anyway. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, it wouldn't 
        have taken much to get me to buy something from someone else. I guess 
        that's the power of customer service. Given his reputation, I can't understand 
        why Mariss wouldn't do something for me. Oh well, I sure hope these new 
        drivers are flawless or I will build the UHU boards.</font></p>

        my <a href="CCMillCNCToDo.html">To Do list for the mill </a>to a finer

      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/LatheStuff/PosRakePart.jpg" width="1024" height="1024"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">First, use the radius on the edge of your 
        grinding wheel to put a little positive rake in the blade. This greatly 
        reduces chatter on a lot of materials. Easy does it, don't take too much 
        off!</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/LatheStuff/PartingHone.jpg" width="1024" height="765"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1">Next, take on of those inexpensive pocket 
        diamond hones and use it to make the tool really sharp. I QCTP holder 
        with the tool on its side on a flat surface, and stand the hone up on 
        it's side. A couple of swipes as shown are all it takes to make the blade 
        really sharp!</p>

      <p align="center" class="style1">This last tip is not really necessary for

        example on my <a href="CCRevOpenCol2.htm">Verburg Steam Engine Team Build</a> 
        connecting rods. A radius like this is essential for such cuts. Put the 
        radius on the side you'll be moving into the cut. The radius shown gives 
        you a tool that can take shallow turning cuts moving from tailstock to 
        spindle...</p>

      <p align="center" class="style1">Turning with a parting blade makes it easy 
        to get nice square shoulders if you need your smallest OD between two 
        larger OD's. Here, we are about to plunge the blade and we'll be turning 
        to the left shoulder that's visible. Don't try too much depth of cut. 
        A sure sign of trouble is a build up of material on the part at the cutting 
        point. Eventually something will break if that's happening--take a shallower 
        cut! For this little brass part 0.010 to 0.015 on the dial (0.005 to 0.0075 
        actual DOC) worked well and gave a decent surface finish...</p>

        ideal of this design style was to create shapes that looked as though

        were &quot;streamlined&quot; and filled with sinous curves.</font></p>

        like my Industrial Hobbies mill. I came across <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/showthread.php?t=156509">an 
        interesting thread over on PM</a> today discussing what they're capable 
        of. According to Frank Mari:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Drilling and 
        tapping, no problem.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Run a 3/8&quot;

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Run a 1/2&quot; 
        endmill to 50-60% of capacity.</font></p>

        or 3/4&quot; endmills except for light facing cuts on a workpiece you're 
        sure cannot shift or move.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interesting discussion. 
        These parameters are based on trying not to break the pull stud which 
        would wreak havoc on the spindle. The other interesting note is the comment 
        that a Robodrill is much faster than a Haas TM-2, and the comments about 
        the toolchanger: m</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">arvel

        is powered by the Z-axis and spindle, and it's fast too! I'd love to track

        I was a procrastinator! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is quite

        a lot of the parts are missing after all these years so Hilmar has to

        also interesting. Starts out as a casting. Hilmar cleans up the square

        A grinding vise would also work.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Setting Up 
        a Boring Head</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was a question 
        about how to preset your boring head over on HSM I responded to today. 
        I look at the boring head in the mill as completely analagous boring in 
        the lathe. How would you preset things on the lathe? Most people wouldn't 
        bother. To get to a proper dimension on the lathe, at least to a thousandth 
        (tenths require a lot more fooling around), requires two things: you have 
        to know where you are starting and you have to know how to turn the dials 
        to take out what's left.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Think of a turning 
        operation. To know where you are starting, you have two alternatives. 
        Chuck up a piece of stock, take enough cut so you cut all the way around, 
        and now stop and measure the diameter. Or, start with a piece of stock 
        that you know is accurately round and of a known size. Dial that stock 
        in on the chuck, touch off with the cutter, and you're ready to go! Touching 
        off means to use a piece of paper while the spin</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">dle 
        is moving and move the tool in until the paper is just getting grabbed. 
        You're now typically within 0.001&quot; of the surface with the cutter.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a mill with 
        a boring head, you get the same two choices. Start with a rough hole of 
        some kind. Line up on it approximately or as precisely as you like. Adjust 
        the boring head by eye to cut a bit out of the hole. Make a pass or two 
        and then measure diameter. Now you know where you are. Or, you can do 
        the other too. Line up carefully over a hole of known dimension that is 
        also known to be round. Use a Blake Coaxial indicator or whatever your 
        favorite method to get the spindle over the center. Now do the touch off 
        paper trick with the boring head and you know where you are.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other issue, 
        knowing how to make the dials do what you need is important too. Does 
        your boring head work by depth of cut or diameter on each marking? If 
        I advance by 1 mark, did I make the hole 0.001&quot; larger in diameter 
        or 0.002&quot;? Very important to know! Is the little dial accurate? Run 
        some tests and get to know your boring head. My Criterion is a really 
        beat up eBay special, but it is surprisingly accurate. So much so that 
        I used it on my <a href="CCColletChuck.htm">collet chuck project</a> and 
        got within about a thou of where I wanted to be without trying too hard.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now when you need 
        to cut to tenths, check back. I'm not there yet, so I can't help at the

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Carbide can't

        some such. This is on a lightweight Southbend lathe, very similar in rigidity 
        to my Lathemaster 9x30.</font></p>

        HSS crowd will retreat to &quot;I don't need to go that fast&quot; or 
        &quot;HSS is better and cheaper, you just don't know how to grind the 
        tools&quot;, but these HSM's are off doing awesome things with carbide 
        on very lightweight lathes. No, Virginia, you don't have to have a Monarch 
        or Hardinge lathe to use carbide!</font></p>
