      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">More Notes 
        on Indexable Tooling</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a massive and typically 
        inflammatory thread about indexable tooling and small machines over on<a href="http://bbs.homeshopmachinist.net/showthread.php?t=35493"> 
        the HSM board</a>. If you can get through all the posturing (maybe just 
        look at the pictures?), there is some good information there. I summarized 
        it in a post as follows:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ANSI standard differs with 
        a lot of what the catalog charts have to say: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.ccpa.org/pdf/B212_4.pdf">http://www.ccpa.org/pdf/B212_4.pdf 
        </a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The catalogs and the posters 
        here attribute a lot more to those 4 letters in an insert designation 
        than I can read into that spec which seems a lot more related to making 
        sure inserts are interchangeable with their holders than anything else. 
        For all the pages here, there are really very few points being made that 
        matter for making chips: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Positive rake requires less 
        cutting force and is generally better for lighter machines. In fact, positive 
        rakes are taking over from negative even for heavier machines in many 
        cases because the geometry cuts better. You can see that reading through 
        the PM board to see what those guys use/recommend. Negative rake is principally 
        useful for durability, but as the positives get better at interrupted 
        and other "difficult" conditions, why bother with negative? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The meaning of the various 
        letters in an insert designation is pretty prosaic. Some things we can 
        determine from it but most we can't. We don't know the rake unless we 
        factor in the toolholder and the top surface of the insert. Those two 
        are actually not called out very well by ANSI. Therefore, we have to understand 
        our toolholders and the meaning of positive rake and visualize what will 
        happen with a particular insert. Those "sharp" inserts are clearly very 
        much going to have positive rake. Many other inserts it isn't so clear. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Since you can't really tell 
        from just the 4 ANSI letters what's going on, you'd better have one or 
        more of the following in hand before buying the insert (unless you just 
        want to experiment): </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Full ID on the insert so 
        you can go consult the manufacturer's catalogs. This is often hard on 
        eBay. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- A big picture of the insert 
        and enough practical knowledge (more than enough in this thread) to guess 
        how it will cut. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- A solid recommendation for 
        the insert from someone doing similar work on a similar machine. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Help from a rep picking out 
        your inserts. Clearly YMMV depending on how good the rep is. This is why 
        peeps like the "Exkenna" guy over on PM so much, or Frank Mari. Their 
        advice has prooved out. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everything else is a crapshoot 
        and can be extremely frustrating. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as an example, not long 
        ago the CCGT inserts were the ticket for smaller lathes. Peeps thought 
        the "G" meant "Sharp", but it was only the tolerance. It wasn't long before 
        manufacturers were selling "G"'s that weren't sharp because there was 
        demand to pay the higher price. Then I started seeing CCMT's that were 
        Sharp. The whole ANSI business ceased being a useful determiner of anything 
        other than whether the insert would fit my toolholders. Hence the 4 criteria 
        above. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. The idea of a lathe "too 
        lightweight" for carbide is an interesting one. A small Southbend will 
        clearly handle carbide. My Lathemaster 9x30 does too. The ubiquitous 9x20 
        is noticeably less rigid than these, but with the common mods, seems like 
        it would work. What then is "too lightweight"? Unimats? 7x14's? For the 
        hobbyist, carbide is a matter of personal taste more than anything. Do 
        you want to spend your time trying to understand the minutiae of insert 
        selection (feels like stamp collecting sometimes), or grinding HSS tools? 
        Either takes away from making chips, but I like my carbides though I also 
        do some HSS. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last point: Be careful if you 
        have an indexable tooling fetish as I do not to accumulate tools that 
        use too many different insert types, or inserts of exotic design. It's 
        just too hard to keep up with it all. Hence all my mill tooling uses APKT 
        (or equivalent) and all my lathe tooling except the boring bars and parting 
        tool uses CCMT. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apparently cheap toolholders 
        look like such a deal until you're paying $10 and up per insert on a facemill 
        with 7 inserts. Ouch! </font></p>

        Engineering Challenges</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powered drawbars are extremely 
        handy things. They make tool changes a snap. I can vouch personally for 
        how great <a href="CCMillDrawbar.html">the one I made from an impact wrench</a> 
        is. There are basically two versions. The first, and most common, is like 
        my impact wrench version. It literally simulates the normal operation 
        of an R8 drawbar, and just automates the tightening and loosening along 
        with a little &quot;gentle persuasion&quot; ala the mallet tap that comes 
        in the form of the impact wrenches hammering as well as downward pressure 
        from the air cylinder.</font></p>

        commonly seen, and attempts to function more like powered drawbars in 
        commercial VMC's. This one simply uses a stack of Bellville washers to 
        tension the drawbar, and an air cylinder to release that tension for a 
        tool change. The tool is held in an R8 collet that stays quasi-permanently 
        attached to the drawbar. When it is pulled into the taper, it tightens. 
        When pushed out, it releases. This system is a little simpler that the 
        impact wrench in its basic form, and gives a faster release cycle. Hoss 
        built one for his X2 mill:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you can see 
        from the video, it works really well and is very slick. A lot of folks, 
        having seen this style from Hoss, decided to build them for larger mills. 
        This is where the problems start. The X2 doesn't use a lot of horsepower. 
        Larger mills like Bridgeports and RF-42's like my Industrial Hobbies, 
        can have considerably more horsepower. Let's say up to about 3 HP. With 
        larger tooling and more aggressive cutting, there have been problems with 
        the tooling pulling out of the collet. The hobby crowd has basically decided 
        this is just a matter of applying more drawbar force, but there is more 
        at work here than meets the eye.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider that 
        the numerous folks who have manufactured R8 powered drawbar systems would 
        probably love to have a purely pneumatic system so they can reduce their 
        costs, but for the most part, such systems are unavailable. Did they all 
        just fail to build one with strong enough air cylinder and linkage. Not 
        likely. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we take a look 
        at one of the few systems that did see the light of day,<a href="http://www.mach-1tooling.com/"> 
        the Mach1 system</a>, there are some interesting learnings to be had. 
        They say their system only uses a 600lb die spring, for example. That's 
        hardly any force. <a href="http://www.machsupport.com/forum/index.php/topic,11826.80.html">There 
        are reports</a> of tools slipping even with 2500 lbs of pull force. The 
        builder, Scott (Poppabear), comments in that thread about his ATC project 
        for the Tormach milling machine. He tried 2500lbs, and could not take 
        a 1&quot; axial cut with a 3/8&quot; cutter without it pulling out. Ultimately 
        Scott decided the project was not feasible. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is it really just 
        a matter of more force on the drawbar? What if Scott had used 4000lb? 
        Color me skeptical. Drawbar tensions on machines designed for ATC's, such 
        as CAT40, are typically under 4000lb. BTW, these huge tensions need to 
        be applied in such a way that the force is not transferred to your precision 
        spindle bearings with potentially disasterous results. Ray L. did a great 
        job on that <a href="http://www.machsupport.com/forum/index.php/topic,11826.0.html">with 
        his design</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Why is the R8 
        taper so problematic? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        looking over the Mach1, I figured out the secret: there are really two 
        issues to consider. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
        is locking the tool holder to the mill. That's going to be a function 
        of the surface area of the R8 taper and the pull force. I am not too surprised 
        that 600 lbs suffices for that force, even with quite a lot of "work" 
        being done by the spindle. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there is a 
        second force, and the way it works is hugely counterproductive to the 
        first. That second force is the squeeze on a collet to hold the tool. 
        It doesn't exist with solid tool holders, and it is the reason the Mach1 
        system uses <a href="http://www.mach-1tooling.com/tool02.asp">a special 
        R8 collet closer</a>. Note that Mach1 can also use solid R8 tooling. The 
        special collet closer serves 3 purposes:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. It's threaded 
        cap compresses the collet on the tool with a lot more than 600lbs of force. 
        I have read somewhere that 5C collets use 1500lbs of force, BTW. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. It creates 
        a reference surface to preserve the Z repeatability against the spindle 
        nose. This gives the Mach1 system the equivalent of the Tormach Tooling 
        System. Note that solid holders are repeatable already to a few tenths. 
        I've measured that myself before.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. This is really 
        the big secret that tells why the Mach1 system works with only 600lbs 
        of retention. That special collet holder creates a new, more precise, 
        and more rigid R8 male taper. You can see this clearly from the patent 
        illustration:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/Mach1ColletCloser.jpg" width="676" height="517"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patent illustration 
        showing how the collet closer creates a new R8 male taper: #26</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why is this new 
        male taper so important? Because the deformation of the collet as it locks 
        down on the tool really interferes with its ability to make good contact 
        with the R8 taper. If you think of bluing tapers, there is no way in heck 
        that there is much precision in that interface. So now the drawbar force 
        must not only provide sufficient clamping, but it must also combat the 
        reduced surface area and hence friction of the collet in the taper. The 
        Mach1 system avoids all of that. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Folks get started 
        on these air-cylinder only systems because they seem simpler than an impact 
        wrench system. But they're really not unless you're prepared to live with 
        a huge amount of drawbar tension, and even then I wonder how well they 
        are going to work with a facemill or a large silver and deming bit. People 
        keep saying that this has been tried over and over, and it has. The drawbar 
        manufacturers would love a simpler cheaper mechanism, if only one would 
        work. Yet they keep shipping impact wrench based systems for R8, or special 
        patented tricks like Mach1. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I will tell 
        you is that a rookie machinist can build an impact wrench system in an 
        afternoon and it won't suffer from any of these problems. It can be completely 
        automated for use in an ATC if desired. It's simpler and cheaper. Your 
        biggest challenge for the ATC is that you'll be using solid R8 holders 
        which don't have a standard interface for the ATC carousel. That's no 
        big deal. You'll need to fab some collars for the tooling that serves 
        that purpose. Meanwhile, you will be saving a fortune on TTS holders and 
        you'll have a more reliable and rigid system to boot. Don't take my word 
        for it. Look at what industry does, and look at how many have tried and 
        failed to produce an air cylinder-only system. Note that this only applies 
        to larger mills. Let's say mills with more than 1HP.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I got looking at how my 
        R8 tooling was being scattered around the various crowded flat surfaces 
        in the shop, it became obvious I needed a better way. So <a href="CCMillCNCR8Rack.htm">I 
        designed a new tooling rack</a> and set about building it from some 1/2&quot; 
        &quot;poly&quot; plastic I got from US Plastics. I really like how the 
        stuff machines. I didn't quite get finished, but here are some piccys 
        of progress underway:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Couldn't resist 
        a bit of a trial, now could I? While all the holes are filled, many of 
        these are seldom used. I expect this will lead to the purchase of more 
        tool holders. I hate when that happens!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I intend to number 
        the holes, and use the numbers to fill in the tool table in Mach3. This 
        way I can swap out a tool and Z will already be calibrated since the R8 
        holders are very repeatable. Between just grabbing the right number and 
        using my impact wrench-driven drawbar, it'll be pretty danged fast. Eventually 
        I'll build a true automatic toolchanger (ATC), but for now, this will 
        be a big step forward!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="CCLatheSurfaceFinish.html">I've 
        written quite a bit</a> about how to find the right carbide inserts for 
        small lathes, but not much about indexable milling tools and inserts for 
        small mills. Recently I bought a new Iscar face mill that uses APKT-style 
        inserts:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/HM90Facemill.jpg" width="400" height="324"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a little 
        2&quot; face mill, which is about right for the size mill I have. I had 
        been using a Lovejoy facemill, but it uses these SPEX inserts that I've 
        only ever seen used with Lovejoy tooling, so they're expensive. I also 
        have a little Iscar Helimill 5/8&quot; diameter indexable endmill that 
        I really love. It uses APKT inserts and I had heard good things about 
        these inserts in a lot of places such as the PM boards. So, I went looking 
        for a deal on eBay and eventually bought another Iscar mill.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along the way, 
        I discovered there is an insert type called APET that is a super sharp

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The APET is specifically

        as well as the right project. Full details when I get to try making some

        What It Is And Why It Matters</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've gotten interested in understanding 
        more about CNC toolpaths lately, and one of the most interesting topics 
        is cutter engagement. Cutter engagement is the fraction of your cutter 
        that is actually doing any cutting. It turns out that this can change 
        quite a lot as your cutter travels through most toolpaths. In particular, 
        it gets markedly worse in corners. This diagram will illustrate:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/CutterEngagement.jpg" width="640" height="519"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cutter Engagement: 
        Blue = Material left behind, Purple = Material being removed by toolpath, 
        Red = Cutters in two stages of engagement</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cutter is 
        moving right to left through a corner as the arrow shows. I've captured 
        the cutter engagement at two positions in red. Note that when moving along 
        a straight wall the cutter has a 90 degree engagement, but when it is 
        buried in the corner the engagement is 180 degrees. That means the cutter 
        suddenly has to work twice as hard when it hits the corner. I've shown 
        a radial depth of cut of 1/2 the cutter diameter, but the same principle 
        applies (albeit the angles will be less) with less extreme depths of cut. 
        Any time we go through a corner like this, our cutter engagement increases.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does that 
        mean for your speed of machining? Well, to put it simply, something has 
        to give. Normally we run the same feedrate throughout the entire toolpath. 
        Yet the cutter works twice as hard in the corners. So that means we either 
        run a feedrate that is slow enough to do the corners well, and we shortchange 
        the long straights, or we run a feedrate that is fast enough for the straights, 
        but it is way too fast for the corners. In the latter case we get chatter, 
        lousy tool wear, or worse a broken cutter.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of the time, 
        we therefore opt for the former. Most all of the recommendations we get 
        from the cutter manufacturer for feeds and speeds assume we will run a 
        constant feedrate and go crashing into corners, so they're conservative 
        relative to the straight line performance the cutter could deliver. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ah ha,&quot; 
        says the clever machinist. We just need to vary the feedrate based on 
        the engagement angle and we can optimize for faster machining. Yep, that 
        will absolutely work. In fact, it would be pretty straightforward to hand 
        tweak the feedrate on the corners for simple toolpaths. It's tedious work 
        this hand tweaking, but you'll definitely speed up the program. Lots of 
        CAM programs have an option to vary the feedrate automatically as well. 
        How much can we tweak the feedrate? Well, from the illustration, a right 
        angle (90 degree) corner has twice the engagement, so in theory, we can 
        run that corner at the cutter's recommended feeds and speeds, and double 
        the feedrate for the straightline. In practice I would not be so bold, 
        probably opting for more like a 50-75% increase in feedrate on the straight 
        lines. You'll have to try it out and be aware that some cutter breakage 
        is likely while you sort out what works for your particular combination.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Varying the feedrate 
        works, but that is considered Old School these days for a variety of reasons. 
        One of the more obvious is that you'll be able to visible see the different 
        feedrates in the surface finish.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you don't want 
        to vary feedrate, the latest thinking is that you need to create toolpaths 
        that don't turn corners. What? How is that possible? What if I need a 
        square corner in the pocket I'm cutting?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't get me wrong, 
        eventually the cutter will have to follow that corner, but we can do everything 
        in our power to avoid it except where we absolutely must, and then we 
        can do so very gingerly. Lots of approaches have been tried and they're 
        computed by CAM programs in lots of different ways, but in general, the 
        produce a series of arc-like cuts instead of straight line cuts. Imagine 
        something like this:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/ArcToCorner.jpg" width="640" height="641"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine the tool 
        following these circular paths as it converges into the lower left corner. 
        A little clean up pass will be need along the edge of the bound to pick 
        off the triangular waste pieces between the arcs, but in general, we've 
        cut a corner with fairly constant corner engagement. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This can be coded 
        up by hand for simple situations. Cutting a rectangular pocket, for example, 
        or a rectangular slot. The results can be pretty amazing. Check out this

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can see the 
        tool moving in circles as it slices through the slot. The cutter is a 
        1/2&quot; five flute running at 6000 rpm, 1.24&quot; deep cutting a 3/4&quot; 
        wide slot through 1&quot; hot rolled with a radial depth of cut (stepover) 
        of 0.025&quot;. My favorite speed and feed calculator, MEPro, would have 
        suggested 2498 rpm and about 35 IPM, and Geof is able to run 2.5x the 
        spindle speed and over 4x the feedrate!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is more 
        going on here than meets the eye. I won't bore you with the math, but 
        I have a spreadsheet that calculates the cutter engagement given the diameter 
        of the circle (3/4&quot; for Geof's program), cutter diameter (0.500&quot;) 
        and depth of cut (0.025&quot;). In this case, Geof is getting about 23% 
        engagement. It looks like there is a lot of wasted motion on that cutter 
        on the backside of the circle where it isn't cutting, but this motion 
        serves a useful purpose. The cutter is only engaged 23% when cutting. 
        But, it is not even 23% engaged for the whole of the circle. The numbers 
        aren't exactly right, but pretty close if we assume we get the 23% engagement 
        on the front cutting half. That means we have a duty cycle of 1/2 times 
        23% or an effective 12% engagement. It isn't 12% from the standpoint of 
        cutting force, that's why I refer to it as a duty cycle. Rather, it is 
        12% from the standpoint of cooling the cutter. So we spend 88% of each 
        loop cutting air to cool the cutter and only 12% effectively cutting.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That cooling is 
        less important with aluminum, but vitally important when cutting steel, 
        which is what Geof is doing.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The latest CAM 
        programs all have toolpaths that are designed to work this way for arbitrarily 
        shaped pockets and in 3D. Looking at how much more performance Geof got 
        on his simple slot cutting, you can imagine where such CAM programs can 
        radically reduce your machining time. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">R8 Toolholder 
        Repeatability and Automatic Toolchangers</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the issues facing every 
        CNC mill user is telling the CNC software where the end of each tool is. 
        They vary by length of tool. Worse, sometimes they can vary each time 
        a tool is inserted in the machine, even when it is the same tool. If you're 
        plagued with the latter, you have to remeasure tool length every time 
        the tool is changed. What a pain!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most &quot;professional&quot; 
        CNC machines use spindle tapers that eliminate this problem for you. A 
        CAT40 goes into the machine the same way each and every time no matter 
        what. Your worst challenge is having a chip get caught between spindle 
        and toolholder, or perhaps having the wrong drawbar tension. Unfortunately, 
        the R8 taper has a reputation for not being so accurate. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One answer to the R8 problem 
        is to use a tooling system that indexes off the spindle nose for repeatability. 
        Companies like Tormach sell these tooling systems, and sometimes people 
        make their own equivalents as well. These systems have a round shank that 
        goes into an R8 collet. They have a collar with a shoulder that provides 
        a positive stop against the spindle nose. Release the pressure on the 
        R8 collet, shove a toolholder up until the collar makes contact with the 
        spindle nose, tighten the collet again, and you have repeatability in 
        the Z-axis. You can record the tool offset for that toolholder and it'll 
        be the same the next time you plug the tool in. Much time measuring tool 
        heights is saved as a result!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's all fine and well when 
        using R8 collets, but I've never especially liked them anyway. I prefer 
        endmill holders and collet chucks. These have a solid R8 shank, so I have 
        a hard time believing their repeatability is significantly less than a 
        system like Tormach's. It's easy to see why collets don't repeat-- they're 
        pulled up into the taper a variable amount until they lock down on whatever 
        shank they're gripping. Differences in shank diameter lead to different 
        Z-lengths. I see this all the time when I use my 5C collets on my lathe. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But a solid endmill holder 
        or collet chuck has no &quot;give&quot;. Can't you tighten it up in the 
        taper and expect the same result each time?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course I had to try the 
        experiment. So I ran downstairs to the shop, grabbed my HF butterfly impact 
        wrench (I just use it handheld on the CNC mill), and my Z-axis toolsetter:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/P1011108.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>

        Z-axis height. Mill is covered in chips because I was just making parts...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I established 
        a baseline, and then I replaced the tool 5 times by removing it completely 
        from the spindle, reinserting it, and rechecking the tool height versus 
        the baseline. Repeatability was +/- 0.0005&quot;. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I have a hard 
        time understanding why people pay so much for the Tormach Tooling System 
        when regular R8 shank tooling seems to repeat so well. If there is more 
        going on here than meets the eye, send me a note. I'd love to learn more.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Postscript</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got a note from 
        a regular reader who indicates the TTS is all about automatic tool change 
        and being able to change tools a lot faster. Since I have both <a href="CCMillDrawbar.html">a 
        powered drawbar I built</a> and a handheld butterfly impact wrench for 
        my second mill, I'm not seeing that particular advantage. It's a matter 
        of seconds with one of those wrenches, and if you build the powered drawbar, 
        it's trivial to set it up to work with air solenoids so it can be completely 
        CNC controlled.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Others are concerned 
        about how the holders can sit in the carousel of an automatic tool changer. 
        One can use the indexing ring on the TTS as the place where the ATC carousel 
        grips the tool. That's a better argument, but you can't guarantee that 
        with stock tooling. You need a little shoulder on the ring for best results. 
        The problem is the diameter and shape of the tooling below the ring may 
        interfere if things aren't properly laid out. Tormach sells holders intended 
        for toolchanger applications that have an additional groove. Getting the 
        tools to sit at a defined height in a carousel is one I have some ideas 
        about. More on that later when I finally get to building the carousel!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My first thought was servo

        up the servos earlier and they should still be good. The faults were coming 
        only on very short distance moves (I was jog stepping 0.001&quot; to get 
        an indicator to touch off on the bottom of an endmill). I keep my gibbs

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Thoughts 
        on Preloading Ballnuts</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You need a pair of ballnuts 
        with preloading between them to really get backlash down to a few tenths. 
        My IH mill CNC kit came with these for the X and Y axes, and used Rockford 
        parts. The trouble for hobby conversions is that they're pretty expensive. 
        A preloaded ballnut pair is <a href="http://www.automation4less.com/store/proddetail.asp?prod=RP302XXX">circa 
        $150 for 0.631&quot; diameter ballscrews</a>. Put these on X and Y and 
        you're looking at $300. OTOH, single ballnuts are available for $22.85 
        from the same source. Four singles would cost $80, less than 1/3 the cost. 
        Evidently there is considerable value in making up our own preload arrangement!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue when doing so is 
        to suitably place some Belleville washers between the two nuts to force 
        them apart with sufficient preload to do the job, and to prevent the ballnuts 
        from rotating relative to one another as any rotation can reduce the initial 
        preload.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is one person's attempt 
        at this seen on CNCZone:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/PreloadBallscrew/DSCN1489.jpg" width="600" height="450"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those are the 
        square Rockford ballscrews in 0.631&quot; size. You can see there is a 
        collar threaded onto the lefthand ballnut's mounting threads. It holds 
        the Bellville's which push against an inside lip on the left and the body 
        of the ballnut on the right. So far so good. The bracket on top is attached 
        via 2 of the holes that hold the ball bearing return tubes in place on 
        the ball nut. It keeps the ballnuts from rotating relative to one another. 
        Just one problem unless I'm missing something: the bolts are also keeping 
        the ballnuts a fixed distance apart which prevents the preload from working 
        its magic. The nuts have to be able to &quot;float&quot; along the axis 
        of the ballscrew.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an alternative 
        way to machine that bracket so the lefthand ballnut can move:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/PreloadBallscrew/BallnutLink3D.jpg" width="1024" height="521"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A slot allows 
        motion. Ideally we'd use a shoulder bolt on that lefthand side so that 
        we can tight down the bolt and there is a nicely machined shoulder that 
        rides in the slot. I'm still not thrilled with the thin plate, but this 
        design would at least allow the nuts to move along the axis relative to 
        one another without rotating as is desired.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One could also 
        envision a design that uses a dowel pin to slide in and out of a hole 
        in a bracket mounted in the same bolt hole, or even a design that is integrated 
        with the ballnut mount. For example, here is a ballnut mount integral 
        sketch:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/PreloadBallscrew/BallnutLinkModB3D.jpg" width="1024" height="816"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this design, 
        an outrigger from the ballnut mount (green) provides a sliding track for 
        the rear ballnut (ballnuts are red). The Bellville preload assembly (gray) 
        is threaded onto the rear ballnut and bears against the front ballnut.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here is yet 
        another approach originated by Country Bubba and then followed by Pete 
        from TN on CNCZone:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CNCConversion/PreloadBallscrew/PreloadedBallnut.jpg" width="1025" height="769"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a cylindrical 
        housing for the Belleville pack, and a socket head cap screw goes through 
        one of the holes around the rim to lock the ballnut from rotating once 
        the preload is set. Very simple and elegant design.</font></p>

        and Nice Experience with Granger's</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was exchanging some notes 
        with a professional machinist friend of mine (one of those long-suffering 
        mentors who has devoted too much of their valuable personal time educting 
        me on the obvious things I can't figure out for myself, thank you Peter!) 
        and he wanted to know if I was going to tumble deburr <a href="CCComberRotary.htm">my 
        first CNC parts</a>. From his perspective, they looked like perfect candidates. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have a little vibratory polisher 
        that I tried out once on some brass for polishing, not deburring. I wasn't 
        impressed with the results, but I do know that this is how it's done in 
        industry and I have wanted to learn more about it. Peter pointed out what 
        kind of media his shop would use, and suggested perhaps my problem earlier 
        had been impatience. He says smaller machines can take a lot longer to 
        do the job and that I might've needed 12 hours or even a little more. 
        I certainly hadn't run it that long, so thought I'd give another try on 
        these aluminum parts. The other difference is that this is deburring and 
        that had been an attempt at actual polishing in lieu of hand buffing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The recommended media were 
        plastic wedges from C&amp;M Topline. He recommended <a href="http://www.candmtopline.com/media_compounds.html#plastic">the 
        smaller wedge shape on this page</a> for my application. Then I started 
        in with my stupid questions, starting with, &quot;Gee, that's a 50lb bag, 
        I'll never use all that media, is there another source?&quot; Enter Grainger 
        and <a href="http://www.grainger.com/Grainger/items/6A900">this recommendation</a>. 
        Not exactly the same stuff, but available in 6lb quantity instead of 50 
        lb. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course I had to get some

        my surprise when they gave me free shipping. I didn't have any codes like

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I finally got started making 
        parts with the newly CNC'd Industrial Hobbies mill. It was a lot of fun 
        last weekend, and eventually the following parts emerged:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/SteamEngines/ComberRotary/P1011065.JPG" width="1024" height="656"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My first CNC 
        parts. The one on the left has an 0.010&quot; finish pass, and the one 
        on the right is just roughed with a 0.050&quot; depth of cut. The parts 
        were profiled with a 3/16&quot; 2 Flute end mill. This photo represents 
        about 3X magnification over actual size. Full details on how I made them 
        are on the <a href="CCComberRotary.htm">Comber Rotary page</a>...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are bearing 
        blocks for <a href="CCComberRotary.htm">Elmer's Comber Rotary Steam Engine</a>. 
        They're for another HMEM Team Build I am participating in. These are trial 
        runs and not finished parts, although the one on the left was intended 
        to be. Unfortunately, when I measured it, there were a number of dimensional 
        errors amounting to several thousandths in a variety of directions. After 
        wracking my brain quite a lot, I finally mic'd the diameter of the 3/16&quot; 
        end mill. It came out as 0.1837&quot; which is considerably different 
        than the 0.1875&quot; that was expected. That would account for a lot 
        of error! Now I need to adjust either the g-code or Mach-3's tool wear 
        offset to account for that difference and run a new part. I'll check it 
        again, and if that doesn't bring tolerances to acceptible levels I'll 
        keep looking for more things to fix.</font></p>

        the Mill is Back Up and Running!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That power surge was really 
        painful, but I finally got the mill running again on all 3 axes late last 
        weekend. Turns out I had blown the Smoothstepper and 2 out of the 3 Geckodrives. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having gotten the 2 drives 
        and Smoothstepper replaced, the worst part was just figuring out what 
        was wrong. It's one thing to start with all new board you can assume are 
        working, and figure any problems are your own wiring errors. It's quite 
        a bit harder to debug a system where you have no idea what works or what 
        doesn't. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having gotten the axes nominally 
        going, my next task was to tune each axis. Servos have to be tuned. I 
        followed a manual &quot;by ear&quot; tuning process first, and then went 
        back and checked on that result with my oscilloscope. Full details are 
        on <a href="CCServoTuning.htm">my servo tuning page</a>, but here are 
        a few photos I snapped for your enjoyment:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oscilloscope 
        is connected, but the axis isn't moving yet. I also haven't set everything 
        up or you wouldn't see that trace without a moving axis!</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Servos/P1011037.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I use the circle 
        pocket wizard's g-code for servo tuning. Set a small diameter circle and 
        a relatively high feed rate and you'll get lots of direction reversals 
        to use for tuning...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Servos/P1011041.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got my mill 
        X and Y axes up to 50 in/sec/sec or 0.13g's acceleration with the o-scope. 
        Without it, I could only get to maybe 40'ish by ear. Z has the heavy mill 
        head, so about half this much acceleration is available...</font></p>

      <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did not get 
        a chance yet to see what kind of rapids are possible. My tuning was focused 
        on acceleration as it is a more difficult (and many advise more useful) 
        performance characteristic to optimize. I was pretty happy with the results, 
        but I intend to &quot;detune&quot; (back off slightly) in order to provide 
        a margin for error.</font> </div>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Handy Power 
        Tapping Tip: Use a Little Impact Wrench</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I first started messing with 
        these little butterfly impact wrenches from Harbor Freight when I built 
        <a href="CCMillDrawbar.html">a powered drawbar for my mill</a> from one. 
        It worked so well I bought another one of the little wrenches to use for 
        other things. Here is what they look like:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/PowerDrawbar/PB103670.JPG" width="800" height="650"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's the wrench 
        on the right. The air cylinder on the left was the other component of 
        the <a href="CCMillDrawbar.html">powered drawbar I made</a>...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day I was 
        laboriously tapping a bunch of holes by hand and I spied the wrench hanging 
        there. &quot;Isn't there some way to use it for tapping?&quot; I wondered. 
        Low and behold, I came across the following little gizmo from Enco not 
        long after:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/Tooling/TapAdapters.jpg" width="800" height="848"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tap adapters 
        turn the impact wrench into a handy power tapping device!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've seen others 
        use cordless drills, but what I like about this wrench is the way it fits 
        in your hand, is easily adjusted for torque via the regulator, and can 
        be reversed with the one touch paddle switch. Tapping sure goes fast with 
        one of these, and I've yet to break a tap. I keep the torque relatively 
        light and the wrench just stalls out before anything too terrible can 
        happen.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next thing I'm 
        going to do is build a parallelogram linkage to make a tapping arm similar 
        to what John Stevenson shows <a href="http://bbs.homeshopmachinist.net/showthread.php?t=33790&amp;page=4">over 
        on the HSM board</a>:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/tappinghead4.jpg" width="600" height="491"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disassembled 
        view of the torque limited tapping chuck that came with John's tapping 
        head. The torque is limited because 3 ball bearings in little pockets 
        mate with the tapping head to drive the tap chuck. The balls are held 
        in the pockets by the belville washers. Apply enough torque and the force 
        from the washers is overcome, the balls pop up out of the pockets and 
        nothing more happens. John is concerned the the impact &quot;hammer&quot; 
        action is bad for the taps, but I've had no problems. This little impact 
        wrench doesn't have a lot of guts to screw things up except perhaps on 
        a very small tap. He does suggest it would be possible to disassemble 
        the impact wrench and stop the hammering, and I may look into that at 
        some point.</font></p>

        expected to be cutting more ambitious chips this weekend, but a couple 
        of mishaps have stalled progress until next weekend. First, I managed 
        to blow up the X-axis servo drive through some over zealous tuning. Then 
        I lost the Smoothstepper to (I think) a storm in the area that must've 
        zapped it with a power surge. I've already got a new Gecko, but the Smoothstepper

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had an electrician come by,

        for other things). The next logical step is to mount the spindle head, 
        but i'm stuck until I get some parts I ordered from McMaster-Carr. I need 
        the square head bolts needed to secure the spindle to the Z-axis. They
