        to eliminate backlash, I spent the evening writing a couple of <a href="OnlineCNCTrainingCoursesGuides.htm">Cookbook

      <p class="BlogTitle">Gecko Drive Mounting Bracket for CNC Lathe</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After <a href="MTLatheCNCDrivers.htm">looking 
        over what others had done to mount their Gecko drives</a>, I decided to 
        use some heatsink extrusion to make a bracket. I mounted the fuses in 
        the bracket right next to the appropriate drive:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I need to put 
        a label next to each drive so I can tell which axis is which. One more 
        thing done building the <a href="MTLatheCNCDrivers.htm">driver electronics 
        enclosure.</a> The next step is to build a sub-chassis that will carry

        and coolant.</font></p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Tapping Arms</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had occassion to drill and 
        tap some holes on my <a href="CCLatheCNCHome.htm">CNC Lathe project</a> 
        (making a heatsink/mounting bracket for the Gecko Drives), and got to 
        thinking about Tapping Arms:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><a href="http://www.flexarminc.com/"><img src="img/OthersProjects/TappingArm.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><b><i><a href="http://www.flexarminc.com/">Flexarm Tapping 
        Arm...</a></i></b></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/TappingArm3.jpg" width="361" height="290"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/TappingArm4.jpg" width="354" height="455"></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These gadgets 
        are designed for production shops so that someone can rapidly tap a whole 
        bunch of holes. They look extremely handy and easy to use, and I've heard 
        lots of good about them on Practical Machinist (the owner of the site 
        <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/topic/15/436.html">seems 
        to have invented the darned things</a>!). I sure could have used one for 
        my project! The subject comes up on Practical Machinist usually because 
        someone can't do rigid tapping in their CNC. Someone else usually suggests 
        they buy a tapping arm rather than a new CNC. This is relevant to amateurs 
        because Mach 3 doesn't support rigid tapping at the moment. The only bad 
        news is that they seem to cost $1200 to $5000 and up. Wow!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interesting 
        question is how hard would it be to make one of these gizmos? The arm 
        itself is very simple. In a pinch, you could probably use a monitor arm 
        designed for a PC, assuming you were willing to accept a little lower 
        capacity and strength. What about the motor? I'm thinking an import butterfly 
        impact wrench or something similar is about perfect. Failing that, it 
        seems like you could adapt a Tapmatic or other tapping head to an air 
        or electric motor. Whatever motor is used needs to be reversible. What 
        I like about these things is they look like they would make tapping a 
        snap and they also stay out of the way. I could imagine attaching one 
        to the corner of the welding table and forgetting about it. Seems like 
        a perfect small workshop project!</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Big Doings for the Site</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After much head scratching 
        and soul searching, I've decided to decouple the look and feel of the 
        machine tool pages from the rest of TheWarfields.com. You have in your 
        hands the result of that effort. I'm hoping the navigation makes a little 
        more sense, the design is a little cleaner and crisper, but most of all, 
        that it just makes these pages more useful and more fun. Before launching 
        into this move, I spend quite a lot of time poking around the Internet 
        to see what I liked in various sites. I'm pretty happy with the overall 
        result.</font></p>

        on Practical Machinist</a>, and as I watched the feathers fly, what first 
        seemed like total disagreement and conflicting evidence gradually coalesced 
        into a stratified view of the options. It is basically a trade off between 
        performance versus dollars and personal skill. You can offset dollars 
        with a lot of personal skill to modify a machine and improve its performance, 
        or you can use dollars to buy a higher performance machine. The pecking 
        order for dollars/skill looks like this:</font></p>

                One thread contributor, Dirt Rider, proved the lowest end can 
                succeed brilliantly if you have the right skills. He did this 
                even starting with a round column mill, thought to be the lowliest 
                of lows by many. I'm not sure the Haas guys can show nicer parts, 
                but they probably make more of them faster. With that said, this 
                would clearly require a lot of time and personal skill to duplicate.              </p>

              very close in cost to "buy a kit" and also in the demands it places 
              on your skills. One of the best examples here is our very own "Anvil". 
              Track down his threads about his Tree 325. It's an older CNC knee 
              mill, and he produces spectacular results with it: www.anvilbikes.com. 
              There is a lot to be said for finding an older CNC mill whose controller 
              is dead, and refitting it with a PC/Mach 3 controller. If you get 
              lucky, the spindle, ways, ballscrews, motors, and power supply will 
              all be good and you wind up with a fantastic mill for a good price. 
              I've been watching the Tree 325 market myself, and it looks to be 
              about a $3500 machine. One could also easily refit a Tormach with 
              servos. Go find the right NEMA form factor servos, replace the stepper 
              Geckos (2xx series) with servo Geckos (3xx series), and you are 
              done. I would also upgrade from Mach 2 to Mach 3. This would be 
              a trivial upgrade and should allow you to dial in much faster performance. 
              I am surprised nobody has tried it yet. </div>          </td>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b class="BlogTitle">Precision 
        Linear Rail Support With Moglice for Gantry Machines</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been doing a lot of pondering 
        lately after reading an MIT PhD MechE's thesis on designing and building 
        CNC machines. To find your own copy of this 200+ page tome, Google for 
        &quot;Principles of Rapid Machine Design.&quot; The fellow that wrote 
        it is a Professor Bamberg, who injected a number of thought provoking 
        ideas via his thesis into my consciousness as far as how to build machines 
        that will be very accurate yet relatively inexpensive and straightforward 
        to create for an advanced Home Shop Machinist. Once the juices got flowing, 
        it resulted in the 5-Axis T&amp;C grinder doodle below. I wanted to set 
        down here another application, which I've been discussing with JerryFlyGuy 
        and others over on the CNCZone, and that is how to mount linear rails 
        on a fabricated (likely welded) substructure with precision.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The salient idea is to make 
        the precision structure on which the rails are mounted separate from the 
        fabricated (often welded, but could be bolted together) structure needed 
        for support and rigidity. The magic interface between the two is a special 
        epoxy used by machine builders called <a href="http://www.moglice.com/">Moglice</a>. 
        Note that this method is also useful when attaching two parts of a machine 
        together that require a precise orientation to one another, for instance, 
        when getting a column square with the base of a mill, or perhaps even 
        getting headstock of a lathe square with the bed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice, one fabricates 
        both pieces separately, and then bolts them together leaving the bolts 
        loose enough so there is an approximately 1mm gap between the two. A system 
        of setscrews (or leveling screws if you prefer) is used to achieve the 
        precise alignment desired, and then Moglice is injected between the two. 
        When it sets up, there will be a precision match between the two surfaces 
        that retains the alignment achieved by the set screws. One can then remove 
        the setscrews and torque down the final mounting screws against this precision 
        surface, and all will be well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This approach appeals to me 
        greatly for a few reasons. First, it's blessed by an MIT PhD, and was 
        used in a commercial high peformance 5-Axis CNC Grinder he collaborated 
        on--gotta love that! Second, it takes the art of precision machine construction 
        out of the realm of laser interferometers and hand scraping and moves 
        it closer to adjusting a 4-jaw chuck on your lathe. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now to be sure, one does need 
        a precision surface to mount the linear rails to--you can't just bolt 
        it to any old wavy piece of metal. However, that precision is straightforward 
        to achieve with a surface grinding operation. Used surface grinders are 
        cheap, Asian import new surface grinders are cheap, and shops with grinders 
        one could farm the work out to are plentiful. Moreover, it is only the 
        shoulder and the floor surface immediately under the linear rail that 
        needs this treatment. It is concievable that with enough care, perhaps 
        one could even achieve decent results in aluminum finished with a fly 
        cutter and skip the surface grinding stage. It's largely a question of 
        the accuracy you want the machine to achieve. I would think a tenth (0.0001&quot;) 
        would be straightforward with surface grinding.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's see how this looks in 
        plan form:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/Moglice2FramePersp.jpg" width="800" height="536"></font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>A precision 
        ground shoulder in the precision plate locates the linear rail straight, 
        level, and true...</b></i></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice, one 
        would use a bead of silicone cement to &quot;o-ring&quot; the Mogliced 
        gap so all the Moglice stayed in place until it hardened. Getting the 
        plates straight, level, and true should not be too challenging with a 
        tenths indicator, straightedge, and machinist's level as your tools. All 
        it takes is a little patience and skill with these normal tools of the 
        trade. No finicky scraping that requires &quot;touch&quot; and years of 
        experience to do well. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We apply a similar 
        principle to mount the gantry and keep it true. The gantry uprights would 
        have a flange at bottom accomodating the same mounting hole+set screw+Moglice 
        port model shown here. Work step by step, use the leveling screws to get 
        the gantry right where you want it, and inject the Moglice to lock that 
        in.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a tremendous 
        advantage that the structural framework can be built, seasoned, set up 
        and leveled in the place it is inteded to be used all before the precision 
        work really gets under way. I have on my list of researches to understand 
        what is needed to season such a frame. I understand there are approaches 
        based both on temperature and vibrational techniques. Some passage of 
        time would also seem to be advantageous. I wouldn't go injecting Moglice 
        the same day I'd finished welding up said frame, for example. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ran into a query about using 
        Moglice to fill gaps between column and base when squaring the mill. Did 
        a routine web search and discovered the patent application for Moglice 
        is #4,329,238. Also came across a <a href="http://pergatory.mit.edu/2.75/2_75%20Lectures/PMD%20Topic%2014%20Sliding%20bearings.pdf#search=%22moglice%22">fabulous 
        MIT lecture notes on sliding bearings</a> (e.g. what we call &quot;Ways&quot;). 
        It had some interesting information. Sliding bearings made with Moglice, 
        may not require gibs, for example, because the fit is exact. Only the 
        master need be accurately scraped, as the secondary bearing is cast in 
        Moglice. This begs the question, if we have a precision straightedge of 
        sufficient size, can we simply cast both sides of the bearing in Moglice, 
        and do away with any scraping to build a precision machine tool? It would 
        seem so.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One serious negative with Moglice 
        is that it wears pretty quickly compared to cast iron. Provision must 
        be made to protect the ways from contaminants. </font></p>

        of a &quot;<a href="http://www.maxprotech.com/animpump.html">Maximator</a>&quot;? 
        &lt;Hint: Think Waterjets&gt;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apparently this type of liquid 
        pump is exactly the sort of thing needed to drive a water jet cutter. 
        Those beasts are way cool! If you're not familiar with them, water jets 
        use super high pressure (20,000 - 60,000 psi and up) streams of water 
        to cut with. Usually, the water carries a garnet abrasive. The results 
        are very precise and smoothly polished, so it is an extremely efficient 
        process. The fellow that runs <a href="http://www.anvilbikes.com/">Anvil 
        Bikes</a> says he reduced his machining costs 80% when he outsourced to 
        a water jet shop to cut his workpieces so they required less machining 
        to finish. That's quite a testimony! I've read in a number of places that 
        rough cutting to within 0.1&quot; can really save on the cost to machine 
        a part. A water jet would be the ultimate. Flow International, one of 
        the premier supplies of these high-dollar machines, claims their machines 
        will cut to within 0.003&quot;. They do so without heating the part, with 
        little lateral force, and with very little kerf, which is extremely helpful 
        in many cases.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just one problem with all this--water 
        jets are expensive! They also generally take some pretty industrial support--they 
        don't just plug into 110V. Some folks talk about building one from time 
        to time, but I have yet to see anything come of it. But how about this 
        idea: <a href="http://www.wardjet.com/MSeries.asp">There is a waterjet 
        rig built around an air powered maximator that could be attached to your 
        CNC mill to do water jet cutting</a>. How about attaching one to a plasma 
        table to really open up some possibilities? We know the tables can be 
        built cheaply. Brand new, the 30HP version of this thing from WardJet, 
        the M-30, supposedly costs about $35K. Now we can see how to produce a 
        4' x 8' capacity waterjet for somewhere in the neighborhood of $50K. That's 
        still a huge sum of money, but it's way less than a complete new machine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's interesting to watch the 
        videos on the WardJet site. I found it particularly interesting that they 
        use a bed of ball bearings to hold the workpiece so that the water jet 
        doesn't eat up the bed too quickly. The hourly costs are also interesting--not 
        exactly cheap gadgets to run, but the productivity is awesome, so there 
        is a good return. To learn more, I did find <a href="http://www.waterjets.org/">a 
        really good web site that's all about water jets</a>.</font></p>

        to have in the interim before I convert to CNC. In fact, I plan to use 
        them for a little while post CNC conversion to help me diagnose whether 
        everything is working properly and to do some ballscrew error mapping

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Converting 
        a Bridgeport Power Feed for the Industrial Hobbies Mill</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of the 
        interim, I also have a project underway to convert a power feed intended 
        for Bridgeports for use on my IH machine. If you want one that's done 
        and works well (according to all reports), by all means, purchase the 
        <a href="http://www.lathemaster.com/POWERFEEDFORMILLINGMACHINE.htm"><b>model 
        sold by Lathemaster</b></a>. At $249, it's really not a bad deal, and 
        after spinning the handwheels for a few projects, I've come to regard 
        some kind of power feed as an eventual requirement. Here is the thing 
        though. eBay seller &quot;DiscountMachine&quot; (aka Shars) will sell 
        you a Bridgeport compatible power feed for $169, which is quite a good 
        savings, and I have read some positive things about this unit over on 
        <b> <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi">Practical 
        Machinist</a></b>. I'm viewing the power feed in the same way I did the 
        DRO--it's an expendable project that will be useful for a time until I 
        convert to CNC. So, I decided to spring for one, thinking it would be 
        easier to sell a Bridgie-compatible unit when I was finished with it, 
        and that it couldn't be all that hard to adapt it to the IH Mill. Time 
        will tell on the former, but it does not look too hard to adapt now that 
        I have it in hand. I'm partway through making the shaft adapter (Bridgie 
        has different dimensions, of course), and that adapter coupled with a 
        simple plate to adapt the Bridgie bolt patter to the IH Mill and I should 
        be in bidness as we used to say in Texas. I'll write the whole thing up 
        when it's done and working.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And speaking of 
        the CNC conversion for the mill, I got a note from Aaron today telling 
        me they are shipping out my conversion kit. Yup, I broke down and ordered 
        one last month. Considering how slowly the <a href="CCLatheCNCHome.htm"><b>lathe 
        conversion</b></a> has gone, I thought it might speed things up a bit 
        if I purchased a finished kit rather than engineering one myself. The 
        mill is a more difficult project to get right anyway, and besides, Aaron 
        had the darned things on sale. I ordered the mechanicals-only kit, and 
        I'm thinking of using the Kelling Technology motors referred to below. 
        These are 600 oz in motors at a great price, Mariss F. himself has blessed 
        their usage in glowing terms, and I'd love to be able to compare and contrast 
        a stepper system (my lathe) with a full closed loop servo system on the 
        mill. </font></p>

        that be a 4-jaw lathe chuck job or something in the mill. After losing 
        out on something like 6 scopes that all sold on eBay for over $200, I

        CNC Lathe Conversion </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, I wanted 
        to report that their continues to be some signs of glacial progress on 
        the lathe conversion. As the duly appointed and solitary IT support person 
        in our household, I was called to PC tinkering when the fan on my wife's 
        PC went out. Having gotten my hands dirty fooling with a PC for the first 
        time in a while, I thought it well if I got on with building the PC I 
        want to use for the lathe. I've had the parts for some time, but needed 
        to convert a 19&quot; rack mount enclosure I got off eBay (what would 
        I do without eBay?). It turns out to be quite a lot of trouble to convert 
        a generic enclosure to be a PC. All sorts of little holes and openings 
        have to be engineered in. Lots of crazy little things have to be scrounged 
        up, like the little speaker to play your motherboard's beeps at startup. 
        At this stage, I think I've got most of it in hand, and hope to try to 
        assemble it soon. Once I've got a working PC, it'll be time to start on 
        the drive electronics enclosure. That's one of the things I need the box 
        brake for, to make a little bracket to hold the Geckos in an efficient 
        way. One thing certainly does often lead to another, doesn't it?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Odds 
        &amp; Ends</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How about mechanically 
        compensating for leadscrew error? I came across an <a href="http://www.lmwatts.com/index.html">interesting 
        article wherein Les Watts uses a mechanical system to correct leadscrew 
        error</a> to achieve 0.0005&quot; maximum error over 60&quot;, an improvement 
        of 12x over the out of box leadscrew spec. His issue was that he needed 
        to drive a big router gantry with a leadscrew on either side and wanted 
        them to match. One could be mapped in software to correct the error, but 
        what to do about the other? He devised a mechanism that uses a mechanical 
        cam to advance or retard the ballnut in order to correct errors. The really 
        interesting question is not considered in the article, which is, how did 
        he produce the cam used to correct the error? This same fellow writes 
        in great detail of how he produced the very flat surfaces needed for the 
        router using an interesting twist on scraping. Rather than use a scraper, 
        he knocked the high spots down with a hand grinder, and used the standard 
        bluing techniques to test. All in all, a very interesting and unorthodox 
        set of techniques.</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogTitle">Tool &amp; Cutter Grinders</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been keeping 
        my nose to the ground looking for ideas on a tool and cutter grinder. 
        It's ridiculously easy to dull a cutter, and while they're reasonably 
        cheap on eBay (say $10 for a nice US Made 1/2&quot; endmill), it's even 
        cheaper to sharpen them. Not to mention drill bits need constant sharpening, 
        and custom cutters are easily made with the right grinder. I've looked 
        a little bit at the Deckel's and their clones that come up on eBay, but 
        they want an awful lot of money for one. Then there are a variety of cutter 
        grinders that various HSM's have made over the years. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Quorn is probably 
        the most famous. It's a beautifully intricate little machine:</font></p>

        the idea of CNC'ing up a Quorn out of bar stock after I get my machines 
        converted, and I am sure it would be a fascinating project, but there 
        are simpler ways to get the job done.</font></p>

        so I know that what he is offering is likely of extremely high quality 
        and would be worth the price of admission. I quite like the Tinker design. 
        It looks much simpler to build than a Quorn, and I like the idea of harnessing 
        it to an existing grinder rather than having to fabricate a whole new 
        grinding spindle for the machine. It seems to me that doing double duty 
        with the grinder not only saves fabrication time, but also saves space 
        in what will be an already over-crowded workshop for most folks.</font></p>

        set screws are used to square up the machine? Now much later, I read another 
        post from a Tormach owner that says those are not set screws, they are 
        dowel pins that lock the alignment in place. Hmmm. The set screw idea 
        seemed so much better. I can't understand what the dowel pins are buying,

        this mod to the IH Mill had the following to say:</font></p>
      <p align="left"> 
      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I drilled and tapped 
        mine for 5/8 fine set screws, works great, then find a feeler gauge to 
        slip in next to bolt before torqueing it down and do so in stages. My 
        collumn is within .0005 now and i figgure on checking it again after it 
        gets shook in some. I got pics to show where i drilled. I have developed 
        some proceedure/technique to get it righ. only back off bolt so spring 
        washer has enough tension to hold collumn from tipping unwanted, then 
        do tramming, if set gets too tight then back off bolt 1/8 turn or so and 
        further adjust, lastly steal feeler of appropriate fit to jam into gap 
        under bolt and then as you apply torque to bolt check tram and readdjust 
        to complete. firstly tho set slides parralel to table axis as sets will 
        get a bite into base not allowing rotation later on. if done correctly 
        it'll be strong enough to take it all, and the feeler jammed under bolt 
        area will aid in minimizing required readjustment as torque is applied. 
        this is what i did. Also a not on drilling, go in steps starting with 
        a small drill and use a drill guide for every step all the way up to tap 
        drill size then use guide to start tap as well or it'll wander for sure.

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is from a 
        series of shots by HuFlung, wherein he was describing a way to let your 
        CNC machine assist with placing a part. In this case, the machine spindle 
        held a locating pin that ensured the part would be properly indexed relative 
        to the hole the pin was in and the collet. I added this pic for a couple 
        of reasons. First, a fellow over on CNCZone was commenting on how the 
        large table on IH mills might make possible multiple vises so you could 
        tee up a whole lot of work. This represents that example with collets 
        for holding round parts. Second, I had a thought. Since the part is round, 
        the spin indexer doesn't need to be positioned radially with any accuracy, 
        the bottom just needs to be flat with no chips between it and the table 
        (assuming the index and table are properly made, of course!). That's a 
        very cool thing when you think about the amount of trouble needed to tram 
        in a vise or rotary table. I just can't help but think that if you can 
        arrange for the part to just drop into a collet, you can machine the rest 
        of it and the whole setup would be quick. Even if the part is not round, 
        if it has a round boss to fit the collet, you could drop the rough stock 
        in with a boss, and let the mill work out the rest of it under CNC. The 
        boss could even be potentially milled off at the end.</font></p>

          that or over means the spindle is either bent from a crash or worn or 
          has worn bearings. If its not too bad (0.001&quot; to 0.003&quot; or

        for production work. It's all very good information, worth a look see. 
        One thing I noticed that I hadn't read before was a section on squaring 
        the mill. I just got done spending quite a lot of time tramming the mill 
        and here's another procedure that ought to be contemplated. It involves 
        shimming the column base to make sure the z-axis is properly square. Good

      <p class="BlogTitle">CNC Lathe Conversion Status</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By now, you must be wondering 
        if I ever work on my <a href="CCLatheCNCHome.htm">CNC Lathe Conversion</a>, 
        as progress reports have been few and far between. Let me give a quick 
        status recap, because there has been some work, albeit slow. My current 
        task is to complete the two rack mount enclosures and build a rack to 
        put them in. One enclosure will contain the PC, while the other will contain 
        the <a href="MTLatheCNCDrivers.htm">DC Power Supply, Geckos, and GRex, 
        along with miscellaneous relays and other goodies</a>. I started with 
        the PC enclosure, and I am just about done. There are a heck of a lot 
        of holes to be drilled and small hardware to be located before you can 
        turn a generic enclosure into a PC enclosure! You have to arrange for 
        a power on momentary contact front panel switch, motherboard mounting 
        on insulated stand offs, power supply mounting, hard disk mounting, DVD 
        mounting, cooling fan mounting, and appropriate cutouts for all of this. 
        I'm sure I've missed something, but I'll keep drilling holes until I've 
        got a place for all the components and then I will connect them all up 
        and try to bring the PC up. Once it is running Windows XP happily, I will 
        move on to building the second enclosure, followed by the rack that will 
        hold both enclosures, a keyboard tray, and a stalk for my ELO touch panel 
        screen. Whew!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along the way I have also managed 
        to order a variety of components that will be needed, including:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- <a href="http://www.action-electronics.com/cabl-prc.htm#Shielded">Shielded 
        cable from Action Electronics for the Step Motor (and potentially encoder) 
        wiring</a>. I went ahead and bought a full spool as I may want to use 
        it on a variety of projects over time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Connectors. I decided on 
        <a href="http://www.action-electronics.com/audcon.htm#Mic">6-pin microphone 
        connectors, also from Action Electronics</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- A lot of other miscellaneous 
        odds and ends like a SPST switch with safety cover (see below) that will 
        be used to control power to the driver electronics enclosure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am hoping that with the enclosures 
        made, progress can pick up. Since the work of building these enclosures 
        is relatively boring, I keep taking breaks to go do &quot;real&quot; machining, 
        such as the <a href="MTMillKurtViseStop.htm">vise stop I recently made</a>.</font></p>

        flat, and square a fashion as possible. Many possibilities for it were 
        discussed in quite a long thread over at the CNCZone. At last JerryFlyGuy 
        settled on an approach, and a very interesting one it is too. He is using 
        a very fine wire as a continuity test to tell when the rail is straight 
        and a little jig (laser cut) that fits over the square tubing with screws 
        that let him tweak the rail left or right:</font></p>

        to the ballscrew for CNC applications is called the &quot;<a href="http://www.zero-max.com/products/rohlix/rohlixmain.asp">Roh'lix</a>&quot;. 
        They have virtually no backlash, and are much less susceptible to contamination 
        than ballscrews. They have the ability to slip if overloaded, and I suspect 
        this potential limits their thrust and may make them susceptible to losing 
        steps in open loop systems. The Roh'lix runs on just a steel shaft, which 
        are certainly available pretty cheaply. May be worth a look for certain 
        applications. Given their low thrust capability, they are said to be excellent 
        for CMM machines. I wonder how well they would work for a plasma table? 
        They are also available with a quick disconnect option which would make 
        manual positioning possible. The Roh'lix patent is 4947698. I wonder how

        the laser interacts with fine metal powder that is coated with a laser-sensitive

        been fully solidified, the object is placed in an oven that has just the

        intended to be plasma cut from metal and then assembled with silver solder 
        or welds. The plans she provides are for a 14&quot; tall model, but I 
        would love to make one much larger. Will have to look at what my <a href="CCPlasmaCNCHome.htm">plasma

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are handy 
        when cross drilling shafts. You'll note it is build around a captive V-Block, 
        and there is a gizmo to hold a drill bushing at the top that is on a couple 
        of sliding rods. This one is store bought, but it seems like an ideal 
        quick project for a machinist to build one. </font></p>
