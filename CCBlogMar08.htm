        They're inexpensive and well made, a rare combination in this business.

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With these two

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Carbide, 
        Blue Chips, and Taking Out the Heat</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/showthread.php?t=154429">There's 
        an excellent thread over on PM</a> about a subject I've tried to explain 
        many times that a lot of people have a hard time with. If you run carbide 
        tooling at the right feeds and speeds, you will get screaming hot blue 
        chips off steel, but it will actually remove most of the heat from the 
        workpiece and tool. It's this heat removal thing that folks have a hard 
        time believing. The same principle is an important tenet of dry machining. 
        Many tooling sales reps are evidently telling folks to turn off the coolant 
        over 400 SFM and you'll actually prolong the tool life.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HSS tooling, OTOH, 
        has to be run much much slower. The chips should be barely straw colored 
        or you're burning up the tool. At those speeds, not much heat is being 
        carried away in the chips.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just to give an 
        idea, here are some blue chips I made with a brazed carbide tool in a 
        flycutter when surfacing the table for my <a href="CCDiscSander.htm">12&quot; 
        Disc Sander</a> project:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/DiscSander/P1010123.JPG" width="800" height="885"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other thing 
        people have a hard time believing is that you can use carbide in hobby-class 
        machines. I'm here to tell you it can be done and it works well. You need 
        to track down the right tooling, and carbide won't be right for all situations, 
        but it is amazing how well it works. Those blue chips are darned hot though, 
        so don't let them go down your collar, and wear the right eye protection 
        and follow the safety guidelines. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BTW, the chips 
        above are not the greatest shape. I used a brazed carbide lathe tool in 
        the flycutter, which is pretty common, but their geometry is not ideal 
        for this application. On my lathe, I get perfect little blue 6's and 9's. 
        However, despite the heavy blue chips, the surfaced table and the carbide 
        tool were barely warm to the touch when I finished.</font></p>

        little machine:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Machines/kx1.jpg" width="650" height="680"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks to <a href="http://bbs.homeshopmachinist.net/showthread.php?t=28098">John 
        Stevenson who participated in the development testing</a> for this machine 
        for posting a picture of one. He says it differs from the X1 in having 
        a fixed and heavier column, ballscrews on all axes, and limit switches. 
        Power is a 3/4 HP 3 phase brushless motor under full CNC control with 
        speeds from 100 to 6,300. You gotta love how it's set up at least to handle 
        mist coolant. This is one very professional looking machine. I bet they'll 
        sell quite a few, and this is just the beginning of turnkey hobby CNC 
        from China. Apparently Sieg has a purpose-built factory just for this 
        class of machine.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It did a very

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Some Nice 
        Upgrades to the HF Tool Grinder</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The HF Tool Grinders 
        are an amazing bargain right out of the box, but with a few upgrades, 
        you can really make one sing. Most people start out adding new wheels 
        as the ones that come with the grinder are not so great. Don't get me 
        wrong, they work, I used the originals on mine for a long time, but professional 
        quality wheels are a lot nicer. To get a wheel swap done properly, you'll 
        need to make sure the wheels are balanced. You don't want an unbalanced 
        wheel spinning at 3400 rpm--if it flys apart from the stress someone could 
        be seriously injured and there will certainly be some damage to your shop.</font></p>

        Tips: Use Your Height Gage on Mill Setups</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Fidgiting 
        Widgitmaster is working on a new design, it means there will be a blizzard 
        of interesting things to learn. This time around he is <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=52420&amp;page=6">machining 
        the upright arms of his new router design</a>, which required a bit of 
        work to setup on the mill as they're not a simple rectangular shape:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Widgit/HtGageMill100_2967.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">See the 1/2&quot; 
        pin right where the light is shining?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The challenge 
        was to line up for a mill pass on a piece cut from the bandsaw. The top 
        edge to the left and right were cut via the mill and then connected in 
        the middle by a bandsaw cut:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Widgit/HtGageMill100_2964.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So how does the 
        height gage fit in? The mill cuts are precision cuts, done with a 1/2&quot; 
        end mill. Widget plases a 1/2&quot; pin in the crook where the end of 
        the mill cut is and then uses his height gage to see what that height 
        is. Now for the other end (on the left), he can use the jack screw until 
        the same measurement is reached on the height gage. Now he knows the piece 
        is clamped on squarely. BTW, there are two uprights clamped together so 
        they'll be the same size!</font></p>

        Update</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite much procrastination, 
        I have made progress on filling my mill base with Epoxy Granite. All the 
        bays except the big hole under the column have been filled:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010336.JPG" width="700" height="381"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Epoxy is 
        still wet on the two small bays in the middle...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My biggest concern 
        as I got to this stage has been leaking epoxy. The silicone sealed about 
        95%. The leakage has all been around the pipes, which are evidently hard 
        to get a good seal on. They're not accessible. I tried to make it work 
        by putting a big giant fillet of silicone on the pipe and then plunking 
        it down carefully with no side to side motion. However, I still got a 
        couple small leaks. They were not really a problem, except that such a 
        leak on any of the 4 column mounting bolts would be a mess:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010339.JPG" width="700" height="485"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can't afford 
        an epoxy leak on the threaded holes for the column mounting bolts!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After much thought, 
        I decided to insert the bolts partially in their holes and then pour candle 
        wax on top until it was above the pipe/casting seam. The idea is that 
        the wax would harden and keep the epoxy out. I used an ordinary cheap 
        candle and torch to melt the wax:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010340.JPG" width="700" height="373"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process was 
        easy, the theory was good, and the initial appearance also looks good. 
        We'll see after the last epoxy has dried if I can get the wax out and 
        the threads for the bolts are still good!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next engineering 
        challenge: figuring out how to mount my big central bolt that will add 
        additional clamping to the column. I bought a 15&quot; long 1 1/8&quot; 
        bolt and nut. Initially, I wanted to just cast the bolt into the base, 
        but the thing is huge and will make handling the base awkward. I need 
        to fab something up so the bolt is removable. This also means I'll have 
        to put the base on leveling feet. Still thinking it over before I pull 
        any triggers.</font></p>

        Three Collet Chucks and their Runout</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of my 
        recent efforts to build a one shot oiling system for my IH mill, I discovered 
        there was significant runout in my ER32 collet chuck setup that was causing 
        me to break 1/8&quot; ball end mills right and left. So, I promptly concluded 
        this was because I had a cheap ER32 chuck I'd bought from 800watt on eBay, 
        and it was time to shell out for nicer chucks. I found 2 Bison chucks 
        with R8 shanks on eBay, and promptly bought them. Bison is a great name. 
        Later I learned I couldn've bought Maritool chucks for less (also a great 
        name), but I digress. The chucks arrived today and I wanted to see what 
        the runout was. Here's what I found out (hint, the Bisons have lower runout 
        than the cheap chuck, but the cheapie wasn't bad and this wasn't my problem):</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 collet chucks, 
        a 1/8&quot; collet, and a 1/8&quot; pin gage. I checked the pin carefully 
        on the surface plate and its straight and true. Yep, I kissed the vise 
        with the old collet chuck, but it was just the aluminum jaws so it rubbed 
        a little of the black oxide off.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I wanted to 
        measure the runout of the pin 1&quot; below the chuck on all chucks to 
        ensure I was making an apples to apples comparison. BTW, what's wrong 
        with this picture, whcih I staged too hastily after the fact?</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doh! Now I gotta

        deal on :&quot;nice&quot; ones I found was <a href="http://www.maritool.com/">Maritool</a>--Bisons 
        were quite a bit more money. FWIW, Maritool is a company many on the PM 
        boards swear by, and they're pretty picky. So I ordered the Maritool collets. 
        Will report on them when they arrive. BTW, Mari has a great deal on ER32

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">HSS vs High 
        Positive Rake Turning Tooling</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can get pretty 
        much everything done that I need to get done with my carbide insert lathe 
        tooling. But, there are persistent rumors out of the HSS steel camp that 
        it's better:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Many claim a 
        better surface finish.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- There is a claim 
        that finer &quot;dust&quot; cuts can be taken that allow for greater precision.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly you 
        can make tool shapes in HSS on the grinder that don't exist in insert 
        form too. I recently made a form tool in order to make a new pulley for 
        the window regulator on my brother's Audi TT. It was great. Would've taken 
        longer to make the form tool than the pulley if I hadn't decided to cannibalize 
        an old cutoff tool I had ground a long time ago. I like to learn new things, 
        so I keep fiddling around with HSS off and on, seeking enlightenment. 
        <a href="http://www.homemodelenginemachinist.com/index.php?topic=1494.0">I 
        kicked off a thread over on HMEM about sharpening</a>, but so far I haven't 
        learned too much. The assumption of most of the contributors is that I 
        need to start at the very beginning, and I'm past that point, I want the 
        second semester course. I have ground HSS according to the classic formulas 
        offered up in places like South Bend's Running a Lathe book. There has 
        to be more than that, else I won't be bothering much with HSS because 
        it doesn't perform any better than insert tooling.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At some points 
        reading the discussion, I sometimes wonder whether the two camps have 
        any awareness of what the other is doing. Do the carbide guys do enough 
        HSS to realize its advantages? My assumption is they don't, and I'm trying 
        to remedy that in my own case. But the converse is also true: do the HSS 
        guys know what really good carbide tooling is capable of? I read so often 
        from machinists who say there is no point in carbide tooling, or worse, 
        that it can't be run properly on anything but super high performance Monarch 
        10EE and Hardinge lathes. That's total hogwash, period, full stop. See 
        the Cookbook section for information on how to use carbide tooling, what 
        to look for, and how well it works.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given my concern 
        that the two camps don't talk, I fear there is a real possibility that 
        there may not be any magic in HSS, and it will therefore remain seldom 
        used in my shop. After all, a new insert is $3, it takes seconds to install, 
        they last a long time, and they have multiple edges you can use. If the 
        HSS doesn't perform convincingly better in some way, why bother? It isn't 
        saving much money (unless you object to the price of indexable turning 
        tools), and it does take time as well as its own tooling costs (tool grinder, 
        diamond laps, wheels, etc.).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, I embarked 
        on yet another trial with HSS. There was some interest in the super-high 
        positive rakes I use, which I mentioned on the thread. There was also 
        continued admonition that HSS isn't hard, that there are no particular 
        secrets, and that one has to just do it. Thank you Nike!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Accordingly, I 
        compared performance of a couple of HSS tools with the CCGT insert tooling. 
        Here is the summary visual result:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/P1010306.JPG" width="700" height="522"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have 2 fairly 
        classic shapes in HSS. At the top left is a very large radius finishing 
        tool. It's set up to cut right to left (towards the headstock) rather 
        than the usual &quot;cut either way&quot; because I needed to get a little 
        closer to a shoulder with it for one project. At bottom is a classic HSS, 
        small radius, high rake &quot;knife tool&quot;. It looks burnt to a crisp 
        yellow, but that is a lighting effect. You can see the CCGT inset at top 
        right looks yellow too, and I can assure you it is silver. Each tool is 
        more or less pointing to a section of mild steel rod so you can compare 
        the surface finishes. It's extremely hard to capture the nuances in a 
        picture, but visually, the best finish is the HSS finishing tool, followed 
        by the CCGT insert, followed by the knife tool. All in all, I see perhaps 
        a very slight advantage in the finishing tool, but otherwise, the CCGT 
        does the job.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm still waiting 
        to learn how to best carbide with HSS.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">High Positive 
        Rake Turning Tooling: CCGT</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The very high 
        postitive rake inserts I like to use look something like this:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/ccgt.jpg" width="158" height="128"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The little buggers 
        are hard to find, though, so I spent a little time doing some research. 
        For some reason, they tend to be identified as &quot;CCGT&quot; rather 
        than &quot;CCMT&quot;. According to ISO, all the &quot;G&quot; is supposed 
        to mean is that the insert was made to tighter dimensional tolerances. 
        It is a plugin for CCMT. Likewise TCGT fits TCMT for triangular inserts 
        used on something like a boring bar.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went deep into 
        the manufacturer's sites to track down this insert shape, because that's 
        the key. Regular CCMT's often have some positive rake, but nothing like 
        this. What I discovered is that the major insert makers have a special 
        line of this style insert:</font></p>
      <p align="left"> 
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><a href="http://www.iscar.com/ProductLines/Pdf/VCGT_CCGT.pdf">Iscar 
          CCGT-AS </a></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Valenite CCGT-1L</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      </font> 
      <p></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each one has a 
        slightly different sales pitch about why you'd use the insert. Iscar is 
        pushing them as offering such a fine finish for aluminum that no grinding 
        is needed, for example. The recommended materials even vary across the 
        lines. What started out as an aluminum super finishing insert can be had 
        in formulations that extend to high temperature allows, stainless, and 
        other possibilities.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the bad news. 
        Since they aren't nearly as common as regular CCMT's, and they seem relatively 
        new, they cost more money. <a href="http://www.carbidedepot.com/Dynamiclanding.aspx?CategoryID=594">Carbide 
        Depot has a page</a> offering many of these inserts. You can find them 
        much more cheaply on eBay, but they are often poorly identified. My rule 
        is if I can't clearly see the high positive rake design in the picture, 
        I won't take the chance on eBay. By shopping carefully, I've managed to 
        buy 20 or so of these inserts, which will last me for quite a while.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Thoughts 
        on Positive Rake with Indexable Tooling</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Positive rake 
        is generally goodness, especially for home shops. Positive rake reduces 
        cutting forces, and that's important for machines that may not be as solid 
        as a big VMC to start with. There are two ways to achieve positive rake. 
        First, is to build it into the carbide insert itself. Consider the following 
        CCMT insert:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/CCMT.jpg" width="382" height="287"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Slight positive 
        rake before we hit the chipbreaker...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has very slight 
        positive rake as the surface dips down from the cutting edge as you move 
        towards the center before you hit the chipbreaker. It's kind of hard to 
        see here, but trust me, it's there. Now let's look at this CCGT insert 
        (compatible with the CCMT, but ignore the CCGT designation and focus on 
        the shape):</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/LatheStuff/ccgt.jpg" width="158" height="128"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Huge built-in 
        postitive rake!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This insert is 
        designed for aluminum finishing. Note the huge positive rake that's built 
        right into the insert! These little jewels are hard to find, but they 
        will put an amazing finish on aluminum and they work quite well on steel 
        too. Their disadvantage is the edge is thin, so they can be a bit brittle.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second way 
        is to angle the insert to incr</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ease 
        whatever rake it may already have. Some inserts, like TPG's, are flat 
        on top, and have no rake. You have to angle them to get any. Here's a 
        triump of marketing over substance. The following face mill is advertised 
        as having &quot;90 degrees positive rake&quot;:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/NoRakeFaceMill.jpg" width="512" height="385"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">90 degree positive 
        rake!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It uses TPG inserts 
        which are mounted dead vertical. There's no positive (or negative) rake 
        at all for this face mill. It's neutral. Now consider this one that is 
        advertised as having &quot;75 degrees positive rake&quot;:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/75DegRakeFaceMill.jpg" width="425" height="366"> 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we can visibly 
        see some rake. The inserts are &quot;laid back&quot;. That means lower 
        cutting forces and often a better surface finish. Incidentally, these 
        two are both available cheaply from <a href="http://www.cdcotools.com/index.php">CDCO</a>. 
        Another incidental is that the 75 degree rake face mill is the one Widgitmaster 
        has told me he uses most often, and I can tell you his surface finishes 
        are superb!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Epoxy Granite 
        Mud Pie Test Was Successful</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's what we 
        got the next morning:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Test was successful!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The test was successful. 
        The aggregate is embeded in the epoxy. The slug took a very accurate impression 
        from the cup--you can even see scratches made in the plastic by the gravel's 
        sharp edges are faitfully reproduced. I suspect creating a precision surface 
        in this material is easy if you have a precision mold. The material released 
        easily from the plastic cup--just a couple sharp raps on workbench and 
        it dropped right out. The ugly parts are at the air-epoxy interface from 
        the top of cup. There are various approaches to eliminating the air bubbles, 
        but it doesn't seem like there were many bubbles trapped in the material 
        from the mixing process--they're all at the top. A quick pass with a heat 
        gun is rumored to be the quick trick to get rid of those.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point, 
        I can't see much point in monkeying with success. It may be that a 10% 
        epoxy formula would be better, but this will work just fine for this project. 
        I plan to keep Epoxy Granite in mind for other projects. I understand 
        it sets up with an accuracy of 0.001&quot; on top if you get rid of bubbles, 
        so you could make a surface plate from it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also consider 
        the aesthetic potential if you embed something more interesting than pebbles 
        and sand to make <a href="CCMicartaIdeas.htm">Micarta</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A Tip:</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a couple 
        minor imperfections, total area maybe 1/4 square inch, where the gravel 
        shifted and prevented good epoxy contact with the cup. Of course I turned 
        the sample around so no ugly spots were photographed! If I were making 
        something where such ugly spots mattered, I think the answer is to paint 
        the mold with a thin layer of epoxy, say 1/8&quot; or so, before introducing 
        the epoxy granite mix. That would ensure a little safety margin. With 
        the pumps, it's real easy to mix a little epoxy in a cup and use a chip 
        brush to apply it.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
        nothing quite like a tailstock DRO either:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/lathe-w-mods-2.jpg" width="700" height="464"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's interesting 
        to note that none of this is necessary or useful on a CNC lathe. There, 
        you'll put your drill bit in the same place as any other tool because 
        the CNC can line it up on the centerline very easily. Actually, it's fairly 
        easy to do even without CNC, and many say it makes for a more accurate 
        hole. On a CNC, the tailstock is stricly used to support and add rigidity.</font></p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Killer Tilting Angle Table</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saw this gorgeous beauty over 
        on the HSM board just now:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/AngleTable.jpg" width="600" height="800"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's how tooling 
        ought to be made, as opposed to how it all too often comes from the cheaper 
        suppliers. That table is solid, and allows for greater angles than the 
        import tables do.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking at how 
        beefy this table is made me think of a 4th axis with tombstone arrangement, 
        like this:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/4thAxisTombstone.jpg" width="640" height="427"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine an arrangement 
        like that with your rotary table and you'd have the ultimate tilting table 
        arrangement. I'd build the heck out of the tombstone, with a flange that 
        is the diameter of the rotab's surface and holes to fit a T-bolt on every 
        slot the rotab has. I'd even consider building a hollow tombstone whose 
        center was filled with <a href="CCMillEpoxyFill.htm">Epoxy Granite</a> 
        as a cheaper approach than buying such a big slab of cast iron. That's 
        make a real nice project. The other thing to think about is what sort 
        of tailstock features might contribute to rigidity. A pretty normal tailstock 
        is shown here, but something more like this is beefier: </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Geof4Axis.jpg" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A purpose built 
        tailstock that was seriously beefy and had a rotating flange with a hollow 
        MT-compatible bore to allow standard lathe-style live centers would be 
        neat. Put some kind of monster tapered roller bearing or bushing arrangement 
        to stop the flange rotating when desired, or just use a dead center and 
        let the flange rotate so long as it has no play and is solid.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I get ready 
        to build a 4th axis, I'll be thinking along these lines, probably with 
        the whole assembly mounted on a tooling plate for easy swap in and out. 
        FYI, I bid on and got a 50:1 reduction Bayside Harmonic Drive, which will 
        be an ideal basis to build a 4th axis around. Much better than a rotab--no 
        backlash. I'm also going to want to install some way of locking the axis 
        during cutting, probably using a compressed air powered clamp or perhaps 
        a system like the pros use involving meshing bevel &quot;face gear&quot; 
        teeth:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/FaceGears.jpg" width="150" height="145"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep the teeth 
        apart and you're unlocked, bring the teeth together and the axis is locked. 
        One set of teeth are keyed to the shaft, the other are rigidly mounted 
        to the chassis.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They seem like 
        a deal for $80 from eBay seller govnuk. Bijur no longer manufactures them. 
        These are New Old Stock, so eventually govnuk will run out. What you get 
        is just the coolant tank. It has a 1 gallon capacity, site gas, pressure 
        regulator, and solenoid valve. The seller includes an instruction sheet 
        with it, and says he has nozzle assemblies, but those aren't listed on 
        eBay. I plan to make my own mister nozzle, see my <a href="CCWishListFutures.htm">project

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get one of 
        these working you'll need to put together a nozzle, plumb it to the tank, 
        provide air to the tank, and provide electrical to the solenoid valve 
        that triggers the coolant. The valve is ideal for a CNC system because 
        its easy to use a relay to control your coolant. For a manual machinist, 
        you'll want to rig a switch probably alongside your spindle controls.</font></p>

        get a CNC project done. Here are a few specs on the G540, which is the 
        more interesting to me:</font></p>
      <p>

          pattern, up to #6 screw size (38mm by 152mm) The pricing is the major 
          selling point with these drives: The G250 will be selling for around 
          $35 each, and the G540 will be selling for under $300 (Prices are yet 
          to be finalized until the first 1000 are run and we have a good idea

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got a knock-off of the Blake 
        Coaxial Indicator from Shars and got a chance to try it out today. Man, 
        what a cool gadget!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here it is in action as I center 
        the spindle over that hole so I can use my boring head to make a shoulder 
        on the hole:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/ZAxisMod/P1010262.JPG" width="700" height="522"></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picture that long 
        feeler as being sort of like a very exagerated finger from a dial test 
        indicator. It goes against the inside of the hole, or there are curved 
        feelers for the outside of a round boss. You turn on the spindle at the 
        lowest rpm, say 100rpm, and hold the horizontal rod. This keeps the indicator 
        facing your way while the feeler sweeps around the circumference of the 
        feature you want to center on. As the feeler sweeps around, the needle 
        will "kick" because the spindle axis is not centered. Now adjust the X 
        and Y axis handwheels until the needle kicks as little as possible. That's 
        all there is to it, you are done very quickly. What a nice gadget!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adjust the axes 
        one at a time and don't even think much about what's needed. Simply turn 
        the wheel and observe whether the needle kicks more or less. Turn it in 
        the direction that kicks less. When you've minimized the kick on one axis, 
        do the other. I circle back a second time around and got to almost no 
        kick at all. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did not set 
        up the Indicol and DTI to check the result as I was in a hurry, but visually, 
        after I used the boring head to make the shoulder, it looked spot on.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It tool longer 
        to stick the Blake in the R8 collet than it did to adjust the X and Y 
        axes, or so it seemed. Apparently they can also be used to dial in a 4-jaw 
        chuck. I'm going to love having this little gadget around I think!</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's no piston. 
        Instead, there is a wedge-shaped gib that moves down to lock the QCTP 
        holder securely in place. Presumably the machined tolerances are a little 
        different to in that there is likely no slop to change the distance from 
        the axis of the QCTP to the end of the tool. This is the motion the piston 
        causes by pushing in that direction. The issue with repeatability would 
        be that it means your dials on the lathe don't mean the same thing when 
        you change tools. The wedge seems to me will also force the holder downward 
        against its height adjustment screw.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can also see 
        why the wedge-type cost more--they look more complex to make. It's tempting 
        to try to make one though, isn't it?</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">IH Mill Y-Axis Lapping Completed: Before and Afters</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I finished lapping the Y-Axis 
        this evening and consider the process a success. Here are some before 
        and after pictures:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Lapping/P1010255.JPG" width="700" height="528"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before lapping: 
        kinda gnarly with lots of heavy tool marks and porosity visible. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Lapping/P1010259.JPG" width="700" height="522"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After lapping: 
        note how much smoother things have become. There's even a bit of a reflection 
        of the dovetail. We aren't trying to remove all the toolmarks, just to 
        make things smoother so the gibs can be run tighter and we get less &quot;stick-slip&quot; 
        friction.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All in all, the 
        operation was a success in my mind. The surface is noticeably smoother 
        to the eye, but more importantly, you can really feel a difference moving 
        the saddle along the ways by hand. This can be done smoothly even with 
        gibs tighted. I'm skeptical how well that would have worked before lapping 
        with nothing but kerosene as a lubricant.</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Conversion of My IH Mill to CNC Has Begun!</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process of conversion began 
        today. My second IH mill has been sitting on the shelf for a little over 
        one year, and I decided to finally get going on the conversion work. Fortunately, 
        the mill was disassembled before being put away for storage. Equally fortunately, 
        I applied a treatment of Break-Free rust inhibitor to all the bare metal 
        surfaces, so there was no rust to speak of visible anywhere.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make it easy to follow the 
        conversion, I'll be writing a blog on the <a href="CCMillCNCConversionHome.html">home

        special projects such as the <a href="CCMilllOneShot.htm">one shot oiling

        so I'm trying to track and organize it all on a <a href="CCMillCNCToDo.html">ToDo

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't expect to complete

        taking some &quot;breather&quot; projects in between, but I'll post to

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Various people complain about 
        the Drill Doctor not working, but people I respect feel that's a matter 
        of not properly following the directions. So, when they went on sale at 
        Amazon for half price ($99 for a DD7500), I bought one. It sat for a couple 
        of days until I was having trouble with an overused bit that had dulled. 
        Out came the Drill Doctor. I will admit the instructions involve a number 
        of steps, but it isn't that hard to follow them to the letter. It took 
        me 10 minutes the first time I ever used it to unpack it, figure it out, 
        sharpen a bit, and take these pictures:</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">On the Business of Deburring</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most machining operations leave 
        little burrs and sharp edges. You want to remove these, first so you don't 
        cut yourself or others, and second because its just a bit of craftsmanship 
        that ought to go into what you are doing. There are a lot of ways to deburr 
        as well as tools to make it easier. Here is my array of deburring equipment:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/Tooling/P1010246.JPG" width="700" height="498"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's go left 
        to right, top to bottom: </font></p>
      <p align="left"> 
      <ul>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Top left is my 1/4&quot; 
          mini-belt sander. That thing is very useful! The fancy nice versions 
          are called &quot;Dynafile&quot; from &quot;Dynabrade&quot;. Too much 
          money. Mine is a cheap Asian knock off and it has worked flawlessly. 
          What a nice little &quot;power file&quot;.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Next we have some 
          files, railroad chalk, and heavy cutting oil. The two tiny little files 
          are Grobet. They're European and can be bought from a seller in Europe 
          on eBay. Shipping is cheap and the files are excellent quality. I found 
          them one time by noticing an eBay buyer was one of the long time posters 
          at one of the boards and checking into what he'd been buying to get 
          some ideas. The larger files are Nicholson's. One is a normal mill file, 
          while the other is a &quot;Lathe&quot; file. Lathe files are superb 
          for use on the lathe. I use the chalk and heavy sulfurized cutting oil 
          to keep the files from loading up. It helps. I should've pictured my 
          file brush too, but didn't grab it.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Back to the left we 
          have a tapered reamer. This is the one I remembered dad using in my 
          childhood. I got one, but almost never use it. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;The air drill with 
          Keo Zero Flute is my favorite fast way to deburr a hole. Watch for the 
          Keo's to be on sale at Enco and other places as they're not cheap otherwise. 
          I've got a smaller Keo in the little hand crank drill too.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Two scrapers. One 
          is a conventional blade scraper with swiveling blade. It works fantastically 
          well for a lot of things. Larger holes are easily deburred with a quick 
          swipe as are long straight edges. Use only sharp blades or they start 
          to catch and leave nicks. The other is actually a plastics and laminate 
          cutter made by Olfa. I got the idea for the latter from <a href="http://www.homemodelenginemachinist.com/index.php?topic=241.0">Bogstandard 
          on the HMEM boards</a>.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Far left are two pieces 
          of 220 grit stone. They're a real handy size for the lathe and other 
          work. I think mine are made by Gesswein, which is a good brand. I got 
          a box of them on ebay for cheap that will last a lifetime.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;All the way on the 
          right I'm demonstrating a Guy Lautard technique of using a file with 
          a bit of sandpaper wrapped over it. This works well on the lathe too 
          and will leave a finer finish than a straight file. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Always remember to be especially 
        careful deburring things that are spinning, such as on the lathe. You 
        don't want to get caught up in that or serious injury can result!</font></p>

        Stand With My 0-1&quot; Mitu...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My second item 
        is something also from 800Watt that just seemed too cheap to be true. 
        It's a Universal Vise for tool grinding that I paid $55. These are complicated 
        beasts to make, although Mcgyver made a nice one. Name brands often seem 
        to be big bucks too. I found the quality on this one to be excellent, 
        so I'll probably try to set it up to sharpen cutters once I get a chance. 
        Here's what it looks like out of the box:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/Tooling/P1010214.JPG" width="700" height="688"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nicely made, 
        no?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I found an extra 
        bonus in the box too. In order to make sure the vise would not be able 
        to slide around, 800Watt threw in a couple of the &quot;instant on&quot; 
        mini-Butane blow torches. Handy! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can bet I 
        left him nice feedback. That reminds me, is it my imagination, or have 
        eBay sellers suddenly gotten a lot nicer? In the last week or two I've 
        had two of them refund part of my shipping, I got the extra torches from 
        800Watt, and there's something else that caught my eye but escapes me 
        at the moment.</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Tramming the Mill More Quickly With Your Quill DRO</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tram is the squareness of your 
        mill head to the table. There is tram parallel to the x-axis, and tram 
        parallel to the y-axis (sometimes called &quot;nod&quot;). Depending on 
        your machine, you may have a swivel head that is designed to cut at angles 
        other than square for more flexibility. For machines with adjustable heads, 
        you need to check the tram fairly often and rest it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I try to check the tram on 
        my mill whenever I begin a new project. That's really not often enough. 
        Most machinists I've talked to check tram when they come in every morning, 
        and quite a few will also check if someone else uses the machine during 
        the day. The point is, if you need accurate cuts and the best finishes, 
        your mill needs to be in tram.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At some point, I developed 
        a procedure that I find easier and faster. Here is my basic setup with 
        the DTI on my Indicol and a couple of 1-2-3 blocks to provide clearance 
        over the vise:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/DiscSander/P1010203.JPG" width="700" height="514"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basic tramming 
        setup...</font></p>
      <p align="left">The goal is to have the DTI have the same reading on either 
        side, indicating the spindle is square with respect to the table. The 
        Indicol is not the best tramming setup, BTW. A proper tramming bar would 
        be more rigid and less &quot;jumpy&quot;. For example:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/tramming_bar.jpg" width="589" height="596"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's a nice 
        tramming bar that goes in a collet...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At some point, 
        I decided to try using my quill DRO and the DTI like a sensitive height 
        gage. I would raise the DTI off the 1-2-3 block on one side, lower the 
        quill until I saw DTI motion, and press the zero on the quill DRO. Then 
        I raise up off the block, flip it around to the other block, and lower 
        down until the DTI registers. Now I can read on the quill DRO the difference 
        between the two sides. Next I bump the head in until the Quill DRO/&quot;Height 
        Gage&quot; reading is 1/2 what it started out. Repeat the procedure until 
        you're within acceptible limits. I was able to get pretty close in 2 cycles 
        of this:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/DiscSander/P1010204.JPG" width="700" height="557"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Head is now 
        trammed within 0.001&quot; on about a 10-12&quot; circle. That's pretty 
        close!</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">QCTP Lathe Tooling</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got 5 new QCTP holders in 
        that I ordered from CDCO. They were $10 apiece, so they were irresistable. 
        I went ahead and stuck some tools in them so they'd be ready to go, and 
        decided I would photograph my collection of lathe cutters for my QCTP:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/Tooling/P1010183.JPG" width="700" height="527"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of it originates 
        from the two sets in from. One is a 3/8&quot; CCMT set from Glanze, the 
        other is a Micro100 set with 1/2&quot; shanks. Clearly they're the same 
        stuff just looking at packaging. The 1/2&quot; shanks are a whale of a 
        lot stiffer though, so I seldom use the 3/8&quot; tools anymore.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/Tooling/P1010185.JPG" width="700" height="377"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back row, left 
        to right: 3 boring bars. The big and little ones are really nice Circle 
        Boring bars. The middle is a very indifferent brazed carbide bar that 
        came in a set. Next up is the plastigage. I like this tool because you 
        can face and turn without messing with the tool, but my CCMT insert tools 
        leave a better finish, so I don't use it very often. Next is my attempt 
        at making <a href="http://www.5bears.com/cnc16.htm">5Bears HSS &quot;secret 
        weapon&quot; </a>for fine turning. It has tons of rake and is kept sharp 
        with a hone. I need to work on it more because I don't get as good a result 
        as I think I should. Next is an Aloris tool with built in inserts. I liked 
        the idea well, but the inserts have not been good performers. Are you 
        getting to understand the insert really matters? I want to try and see 
        if a TCMT would fit it, but otherwise I've quit using it. Last two on 
        the back row are my big Aloris parting off tool and a little HSS cutoff 
        blade I buy from an eBay guy. Both are great tools.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Front row shows 
        the Micro100 CCMT tooling with 1/2&quot; shanks. Then there's my nifty 
        center height setting tool. I got it from Brownell's and it works really 
        well! In front of that is an indicator holder I sometimes put into a QCTP 
        holder so I can use an indicator on the lathe. And lastly, we have my 
        knurlers. The scissor-type I got for $29.95 from Lathemaster. Haven't 
        had a chance to try it because it won't fit in my QCTP's. I need to modify 
        a QCTP on the mill to hold the big shank. The other is the standard knurler 
        that comes with the QCTP set I got.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still don't 
        have all my tooling in QCTP holders, and there are some other holders 
        I'd really love to have (like a drill chuck), so I guess I need to order 
        some more from CDCO. Word on the boards is they're out of stock though.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't let anyone 
        tell you carbide insert tooling won't work with small lathes. It's just 
        about all I ever use!</font></p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Lasers + Video: Multimedia Machine Tool Experience!</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I recently came across two 
        articles that had some absolutely fabulous ideas that are suitable for 
        combining or could be used alone. First up was a <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=48752">CNCZone 
        thread</a> about a dirt cheap laser cross hairs (less than $5!). Real 
        nice:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/LaserMountCross.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Laser cross 
        hairs are offset from spindle axis because the laser is permanently mounted...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But wait, this 
        gets more clever. He added some code to Mach 3 that deals with the fact 
        the laser cross hairs are offset from the spindle. Here are the controls:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/LaserControlsMach3.jpg" width="418" height="245"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The target toggles 
        the laser on and off. &quot;Laser Zero&quot; zeros the machine at the 
        lasers current position allowing for its offset from the spindle! The 
        X and Y DRO's let you enter the offset of the laser from spindle center.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is what the 
        Mach 3 code looks like to do that:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Xmove = GetUserDRO(1152) 
        'X distance DRO </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ymove = GetUserDRO(1153) 
        'Y distance DRO </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Code "G91 G0 X" 
        &Xmove & "Y" &Ymove </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wend </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Code "G90 M9" 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DoOEMButton (1008) 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DoOEMButton (1009) 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The M9 is to turn 
        laser off after the zero. M7 turns it on. He's just using the mist coolant 
        commands to run the laser. The two "DoOEMButton" zero the X and Y. The 
        two DROs are to set the laser offset distance for the script.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>But Wait, I 
        Promised Video Too!</b></font></p>

        together...</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My crazy idea 
        is to combine these two. I want a permanent mounting bracket that holds 
        a housing containing the web cam and integrated laser cross hairs alongside 
        the spindle. We probably want a flip open lens protector as well. I also 
        want it fully integrated so Mach 3 knows about the offset from the spindle. 
        Now you have laser cross hairs when 0.1&quot; is &quot;close enough&quot;, 
        and a 0.001&quot; camera comparator for more precise work that is always 
        there. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The versatility of the Kurt

        Someday I'll write a page of such tricks, but for now, <a href="http://www.homemodelenginemachinist.com/index.php?topic=1275.msg9181;topicseen#new">a 
        recent post on HMEM</a> led me to collect these pictures and thoughts:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Widgit/WidgetViseJaws.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your jaws 
        are too narrow, try making extra wide jaws...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/DiscSander/P1010137.JPG" width="700" height="610"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the jaws 
        aren't tall enough, try using 1-2-3 or 2-4-6 blocks to add some rigidity...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Widgit/Widget0861.JPG" width="640" height="480"><img src="img/OthersProjects/KurtOutsideJaws.JPG" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the vise 
        won't open far enough, mount the jaws on the outside rather than the inside, 
        and you can't mount the vise on your table either way too...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A pair of Kurt 
        vises in the same size becomes even more potent. For example, you can 
        make a single set of jaws that spans 2 vises to hold really large parts. 
        I've also seen sine jaws that have a movable piece for holding work at 
        various angles.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I loved this idea from John 
        over at the HMEM board to cut up rubber refrigerator magnets for use as 
        way scrapers:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it got me 
        to thinking. I could use more protection on my lathe, but I'd like a shield 
        not so much for the apron as the leadscrew. I think you could create a 
        shelf-style shield that covers a lot of the area where the chips fly:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I like the idea of a tooling 
        plate, so I perked up when S_J_H gave a couple photos of his nice plate:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/toolingplate002.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He's using a 
        0.25&quot; end mill to cut out that shape. The stock is clamped to some 
        sacrificial MDF, but there's also double sided tape, which keeps the piece 
        from moving whe n the cut is completed. Note also the dowel pins aligning
