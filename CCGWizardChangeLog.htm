      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a CADCAM Wizard bug that prevented it from properly accessing machine parameters until the Feeds and Speeds page was brought up.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a bug that prevented the unit conversion menus working when the Calculator was undocked from G-Wizard.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.96 that prevented accessing some of the apps when disconnected from the Internet.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">9/2/13: Release 1.96</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.96 is a feature release focused on CADCAM Wizard:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-   Opened access to CADCAM Wizard.  Prior release only allowed paying customers to access it.  Now current trials and GWLite customers can access it.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added 2D Profiling Wizard.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added an option to restrict tool sizes in CADCAM Wizard to Imperial, Metric, or Both.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed all reported CADCAM Wizard bugs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a unit conversion problem in the Feeds and Speeds calculator that was giving incorrect torque values in metric.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a problem where Tool Crib imports via spreadsheet that contained incorrect tool types could prevent use of the crib.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">8/29/13: Release 1.95</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.95 is a fairly major release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Adds <a href="http://blog.cnccookbook.com/2013/08/27/introducing-next-generation-feeds-and-speeds-with-cadcam-wizard/">the new CADCAM Wizard</a>, which is in Alpha test. It is only accessible to paying customers at this stage.   Keep an eye on the results as this is brand new code and no doubt has some bugs. In this first release of the CADCAM Wizard, only pocketing is available.      </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Recalibrated the Tortoise-Hare Slide on Feeds and Speeds to match the slider on CADCAM Wizard. Read the <a href="http://blog.cnccookbook.com/2013/08/27/introducing-next-generation-feeds-and-speeds-with-cadcam-wizard/">CADCAM Wizard article </a>for details.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">8/7/13: Release 1.85</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.85 is a minor release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Adds a new Setup Lock function so you can lock out changes to Setup.   You'll need the lock code which is unique to every account.  Contact us to get a code.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added mouse zoom wheel functionality to all the numbers.  You can hold down Shift to accelerate the spinning with the mouse wheel.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a bug where under certain conditions cut width would appear to be larger than tool diameter.    Internally, it used the right numbers, so this is a cosmetic fix.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Souped up SFM on deep cuts where tool engagement is low.   GW was overly conservative in those cases on really deep cuts.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  There's quite a bit of behind the scenes work to prepare for our upcoming CAD/CAM Wizard feature.  More about that next release.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">4/7/13: Release 1.8</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.8 has quite a lot of new functionality around Tool Geometry, hence we skipped ahead to 1.8 instead of 1.727 or some such. Specifically:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-   Corner Radius is now enabled on the Tool Geometry popup. This lets things like bullnose endmills, button, and toroidal cutters be specified.  </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  All appropriate chip thinning and effective diameter calculations are handled for corner radius.    You can also combine corner radius and lead angle for even more exotic indexable tooling geometries where the round inserts are laid back at an angle.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-    Taper angle is also now enabled for appropriate Geometry types.  So, if you have an endmill that has a built-in draft angle, you can enter that angle and the effective diameter will be calculated based on depth of cut and the &quot;Cut Length&quot; parameter. If you do not specify &quot;Cut Length&quot; on the Geometry popup, G-Wizard will assume the taper continues for the entire stickout.   </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Note:  Neither the Corner Radius nor Taper Angle are being saved in the Tool Crib or Cut KB yet--that'll be the subject of a future release.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-    The Plunge feedrate was moved up on the same line as the RPM, and Feedrate to make it more obvious.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  In place of Plunge is a new cutting force indicator.  Cutting force is expressed as spindle torque in Oz-In or N-m depending on whether you've set G-Wizard to Imperial or Metric.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Effective diameter may now be found down in the HSM area.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">3/8/13: Release 1.726</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.726 is a minor release that:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a few inaccuracies in the Fasteners Database.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Improved flexibility of Feeds and Speeds to trade off in over-constrained problems, particularly when horsepower limited.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added HSS and Cobalt to the Materials DB under Tool Steels.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added C70600 90/10 Nickel Copper allow to the material DB. </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- 6063 T52 Extruded Aluminum added to Material DB.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a problem with custom tool data where the very smallest endmills where being set to 0 chipload sometimes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">1/31/13: Release 1.725</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.725 is a minor release that fixed a few bugs, added C86300 Manganese Bronze to the Materials DB, and ensured compatibility with GW Editor.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">12/17/12: Release 1.720</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.720 is a minor feature release where we completely revamped the geometry menus for endmills.  We'll do an update shortly for twist drills.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">12/6/12: Release 1.714</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.714 is a bug fix release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- The ballnose surface finish calculator had quit transferring the effective diameter so was broken. Fixed that bug and added a button to transfer the stepover back.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug in the taper calculator.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">11/28/12: Release 1.711</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.711 is a minor release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added new material UHMW under Plastics, Hard.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Reduced the SFM penalty for large radial engagements based on my annual review of the latest tooling manufacturer recommendations.  This will result in some higher rpms for many cuts and greater productivity.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- When you redock calculator, it stays on the application you had been using. Redocking is a signal you are done with the calculator, so why switch to it?</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Made a number of changes to speed up the Cut Optimizer by about 4x. Thanks Tom for keeping after me to do this!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed cut and paste from calculator.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug where if you switched from a hard material like stainless to a soft material like plastic and then right back it gave overly optimistic feeds and speeds. Thanks for finding that one, William!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug when importing a custom tool data spreadsheet. If there was a -1 in the SFM column, it would enter 0 for SFM. Now it enters the G-Wizard default SFM for that material and tool type.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">11/16/12: Release 1.710</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.710 is a minor feature release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- If GWC is exited running at a higher resolution and reopened with a screen to small for that resolution, the window opens maximized.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed the problem where saving a machine profile would reset to the first machine. This was causing a lot of confusing.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Redesigned the ballnose surface finish calculator.  Instead of appearing at the bottom near the HSM area, it is now a pop-up Mini-Calc accessed via the Surface Finish button. This was done to reduce the screen real estate requirements as part of our preparations to develop a mobile version for tablets.   Also added the ability to calculate stepover given scallop height and scallop height given stepover.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added a bunch of new materials based on user requests: P20 steel, polyurethane foam tooling board such as RenShape in several grades (hard plastics menu choice), Torlon both as a resin and carbon composite (former is on hard plastics, latter is on composites material family), and added Aluminum Composite Materials such as Reynobond (composites material choice).</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Minor cosmetic tweaks and bug fixes here and there.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">10/24/12: Release 1.7000</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.700 is a major feature release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- The Calculator tab has gotten a nice UI facelift and can now be undocked so it is always available for use with the other tabs. Just click the little undock button in the top right to undock or redock.  This work represents the beginnings of work to reduce the screen real estate requirements on each of the GW Calculator applications so they can happily run on a tablets like the iPad or Android equivalents. Expect more to come.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Printing.  At last you can print any tab.  Just right click and select &quot;Print&quot; from the menu that comes up.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">10/15/12: Release 1.680</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.680 is a major release focused on:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added a Fits and Tolerances Calculator for ISO 256 to the Geometry Tab.  The Calculator is considered experimental for the time being as it needs more testing and user feedback.   If you have questions or comments, <a href="mailto:bob@cnccookbook.com">email to Bob</a>.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Whenever there is a limit hit in the Feeds and Speeds calculator and the numbers turn orange, the calculator will make sure the display is in &quot;Advanced&quot; mode so all the values are visible to make it easier to see where the orange is coming from.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Several minor user-reported bugs were fixed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">10/09/12: Release 1.671</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.671 is a minor release focused on:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug where GWE users with the latest release would see a Post error on loading.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added the buttons for &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Support&quot; just like we added to GWE in its last release.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added QC-10 Aluminum and Machinable Wax (&quot;Wax&quot; on the materials list) materials.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">10/01/12: Release 1.670</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.670 is a bug fix release focused on:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added Instant Registration for GW Calculator trials.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a few more Geometry tab bugs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fine tuned micro-mill support further with better calculation of deflection forces and the rubbing threshold for chipload.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added Duplex and Super Duplex Stainless Steels to the 300 Series Stainless Materials DB</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">9/20/12: Release 1.667</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.667 is a bug fix release focused on fixing some problems in the Geometry tab. This was a signalled upgrade.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">9/5/12: Release 1.660</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.660 is a minor feature and bug fixing release. Changes include:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added a &quot;Generic CNC Router&quot; machine type for new users.   It's only accessible for a new install.  Should help new CNC Router users to come up to speed faster.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added a new Hint that warns when chipload falls to less than 20% of Mfg's Recommended (or G-Wizard's Recommended) chipload.  Chiploads this low can lead to rubbing.</p>
      <p align="center" class="BodyText1"><img src="img/GWizard/Posts/RubbingWarning.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Rubbing warning when chipload is too low"></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- The Tool Tip for Hints (popup when you hover mouse over it) now shows all the Hints messages.  It's possible for there to be too many to display in the 1 line Hint area and we've gotten to a point where GW has a lot of Hints to offer.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Version checking machinery was changed to work using version numbers instead of dates.  The latter are prone to error when the date on the machine is not set correctly.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Tweaked Thermal Expansion Calculator and a variety of other areas to work better for metric users. </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Reset box used to specify tap type when switching from end mills to taps. The same box denotes a rougher for end mills and it was confusing not to reset it.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Tweaked a variety of Tool Crib issues based on user feedback.  Also fixed import/export of the user defined fields.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Improved Ramp Mini-Calculator to allow longer ramp lengths.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">8/6/12: Release 1.651</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.651 is a bug fixing release with a minor feature:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Rewrote the Geometry applets so you don't have to clear every entry each time to try a new value. Instead, whenever a value is changed, the override padlock comes on like in Feeds and Speeds.  You can change to your hearts content. To clear the override, just click the padlock.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed several user reported bugs including one where the geometry menu wouldn't clear when tool type was changed.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">7/5/12: Release 1.645</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.645 is a bug fixing release with a few minor features:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Changed the Geometry pulldown (used to access alternate cutter geometries like ballnose or V-bits) to be a button with a popup. Added the ability to specify a custom shank size to be used when the shank is smaller than the tool diameter for deflection calculations.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added some new materials to the Materials Database: D2 Steel - Annealed (Tool Steel category), Custom 465 Stainless (under the 17-4 PH category), Caldie (Tool Steel category).</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added pre-defined machine profiles for several Haas CNC machines, Tormach PCNC 770, Taig Mill, and RF-45 mills.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed some bugs associated with the warning that rpms are too slow for spindle.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">5/21/12: Release 1.641</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.641 is a feature  release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added the ability to enter Manufacturer's recommended chipload and surface speed right on the front page of G-Wizard. I'll be doing a revised video and updating the docs shortly to describe how to use this feature. For now, if you want to use the feature, enter chipload and surface speed from manufacturer's catalog without any adjustments for a normal (non-slotting) cut.  G-Wizard will make the adjustments needed for the particular cut conditions (depth and width of cut) you describe.  The Manufacturer's numbers will show unadjusted while G-Wizard's surface speed and chipload will show the adjusted values.    Manufacturer's numbers are saved in the Tool Crib, so you only have to enter them once.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Revisited tapping and bumped up the speeds in a number of cases, particularly where carbide taps are in use. GW was being too conservative there.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added support for Ctrl-X, C, V (Cut, Copy, Paste) to various fields that were missing it.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a couple of cases that weren't switching between metric and Imperial properly.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added a <a href="http://blog.cnccookbook.com/2012/05/20/step-and-servo-motor-sizing-software-for-cnc/">simple servo and stepper motor sizing calculator</a> under Quick Reference.  Check out the new Motor calculator tab.  I'll add more there over time.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">4/11/12: Release 1.635</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.635 is a feature  release <a href="http://blog.cnccookbook.com/2012/04/11/g-wizard-goodies-for-the-cnc-router-gang-in-gwc-1-635/">aimed at CNC Router users</a>:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added downcut, compression, and straight flute router cutters to the endmill geometry selector. </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added the ability to specify a minimum spindle rpm.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Increased limits on max feedrates and rapids for metric users.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Removed the chip thinning checkbox.  You should always compensate for chip thinning, so it is always on.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed some bugs on the cut time estimator having to do with improper rounding.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added Rene 41 (High Temp Nickel Alloy) to Materials DB.  </p>
      <p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">2/20/12: Release 1.630</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.630 is a minor feature  release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- We've added buttons so you can go to the correct web page to Purchase G-Wizard as your trial is running out or to renew your subscription if it is running out.  It's also easy to see how many days are left on your trial or subscription as they draw to a close.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added a button to the &quot;Search KB&quot; popup to show all entries.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- <a href="http://blog.cnccookbook.com/2012/02/15/use-corncob-roughers-to-kick-mrrs-up-a-notch/">Re-evaluated the Rougher Endmill performance</a> and upped the feedrates for it.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Added 4 user-defineable fields to the Tool Crib so you can track extra information of your own choosing.  One customer wanted this to be able to track the quantity of particular cutters he had on hand. To use it, click the &quot;Optimize&quot; button and you can name the fields. All cribs use the same field names.  The 4 fields are scrolled all the way to the right.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Cleaned up some rounding issues for the Bolt Circle calculator.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug in tool deflection calculations where we had assumed the body of indexable tooling was made of carbide instead of steel.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a problem with CSV exports of Tool Cribs and CutKB.</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">1/1/12: Release 1.621</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.621 is a bug fix release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-   Fixed a bug where the install link sometimes wouldn't appear on mandatory releases.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed some bugs associated with saving or accessing ballnose and other non-standard geometries in the Cut KB.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- G-Wizard now rechecks the server whenever you change your login.  Older versions sometimes required you to exit and restart to force it to check with the server.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">In addition, two minor things were added:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  The smallest Surface finish on the scallop height ballnose calculator was reduced from 0.0001&quot; to 0.00001&quot;.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- We added EN45 and 9260 spring steels to the Materials DB by request.</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">1/1/12: Release 1.620</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.620 is a minor feature and bug fix release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Renamed &quot;Cap Screw&quot; tab to be &quot;Fasteners&quot; under &quot;Quick Reference&quot;.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added 2 new columns to &quot;Fasteners&quot; database that lists the drill size for normal fit and close fit.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added buttons that appear for the flat head cap screws that will take you to the chamfer calculator with parameters already filled out for depth and angle.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug where the Geometry menu did not display the correct choices in the Cut KB and Tool Crib.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug where exporting the Cut KB to a .csv file sometimes gave errors.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug where going from &quot;Normal&quot; to &quot;Rigid&quot; actually was slowing down feeds and speeds for ballnose and other geometries.</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">12/18/11: Release 1.611</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.611 is a bug fix release. </p>

      <p><span class="BlogDate">11/23/11: Release 1.603</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.603 is a bug fix and fit and finish release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Updated some areas on the Cut Optimizer and Setup to be in metric.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Eliminated the optimization button from Cut Optimizer. It will automatically recalc if you change any parameter on the popup.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  You can now see how many HP your G-Wizard Lite subscription will be able to handle in the Setup About box.  If you subscribe to G-Wizard, you automatically get an additional GW Lite HP for each year of subscription you purchase in G-Wizard.  If you let the GW subscription lapse, the product will still operate as GW Lite, but it will be restricted in the amount of HP it can calculate for a cut.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Extended the timeout on the calls back to our Cloud so that it is less likely GW will complain of needing a connection in cases where the connection is just slow.</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">11/5/11: Release 1.601</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.601 is a bug fix release.   The spindle power interpolation wasn't quite right.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">I also added a direct EXE download for Windows users to bypass the installer for those whose popup blocker interferes.</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">10/30/11: Release 1.600</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.600 is a feature release:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Added a new tool type for lathes: Parting/Grooving.  Nothing too special here, just support for a very common operation on lathes.  The hints will remind you that you can run OD grooving (not parting) a little bit faster than ID grooving.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Reworked the adjustments to spindle HP and added a new type.  You now have 3 choices: </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  No Adjustment: Use the peak power at all times.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Weight Adjusted:   Look at the machine's envelope and weight and de-rate lighter weight machines.  Folks with small machines like Taigs, Sherlines, and the smallest Siegs report this helps a lot.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Power Curve Adjusted.  You may model a power curve with one peak.    Set Low RPM to the lowest rpm your spindle can do, Low HP to the HP (or KW for metric users) at that RPM, Peak RPM to the rpm of your machine's peak power, Peak HP to the amount of power available at the peak, High RPM to the spindle's fastest rpm, and High HP to the HP at the High RPM.   G-Wizard will then interpolate the available HP Limit based on the rpm selected in feeds and speeds.  This is helpful on single speed machines with very peaky power curves.    If you have more than one speed, you could try a different machine profile for each speed.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added    Aluminum 6082 in O, T4, T451, T6, and T651 conditions to the Materials DB. Also added FX-XTRA from A Finkl to the Materials DB.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Fixed a bug in the ballnose scallop calculator where it was being way to conservative on calculated stepover.  Thanks Kvom!</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">9/18/11: Release 1.550</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.550 is a feature release:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- The major new feature is the &quot;Notebook&quot; tab under QuickRef.  Notebooks let you bring in your own reference information to G-Wizard so it'll be handy.  By default, every notebooks has a link to CNCCookbook's home page, the Doc Page for the software, and the Release Notes for the software.  You add your own files or download data from our list.   Initially, Notebooks support web pages, CSV files, and .txt (Notepad) files.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Initial data available for download to your notebook includes: Imperial and Metric O-Rings, Shaft and Keyway Standards, and Split Lockwashers in Inch Sizes.   If you have some worthwhile data to share, please forward it via email and we'll add it to the database.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  New tooling data was added for Titan Excelerator 601 endmills, Melin MVH Series 4 Flute endmills, and Imco M525's.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed some unit conversion bugs.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  Drill chart now shows a maximum of 3 (instead of 4) decimal places on metric measurements.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug that caused paste to paste twice into fields.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added taper information for BT 30/35/40/45/50, CAT 30/40/45/50/60, and NMTB 30/40/50 tapers to the Taper Calculator under Geometry.</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added support for V-Bits used by engravers.   This has been a frequently requested feature.   They're accessed by selecting an endmill, and then using the geometry pulldown to specify a V-Bit of appropriate tip angle.  30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees are supported. This is the same pulldown used to select a ballnose.   Internally, G-Wizard will compute the effective diameter based on the cutting depth, angle, and overall tool diameter.  Recommended depths for engraving are 0.005 to 0.010&quot;.    Feedrates are adjusted down in light of the geometry of a V-Bit (it's crude compared to a helical endmill).  If you have a particularly delicate tip or difficult workpiece, try setting the Gas Pedal slider all the way left.   If you are running a spring-loaded engraving holder, you can as much as double the feedrate.</p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">9/10/11: Release 1.545</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Release 1.545 is a usability fit and finish release.  It's been a while since we had a GWC release, and I have a pretty big feature in the works (Notebooks), but I didn't want to hold up these user-suggested revisions for that:</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Stickout is no longer locked when selecting a Tool Crib tool. It takes its default value from the Crib, but you can change it if you need to.  Thanks Joe!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-   The slot number (T# for a g-code program) appears on the item name for Tool Crib tools so you can easily see which one you're using when programming or working with your CAM package.  Another one from Joe!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Added a dedicated button to set up all the particulars for the MeshCAM integration.  For MeshCAM users, this lets you set up clipboard copies from Feeds and Speeds in a format that MeshCAM understands.  Got another CAM integration waiting in the wings for an announcement from the CAM manufacturer too!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a nasty bug that made all the cap screw data disappear in metric mode.  Sorry George!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">-  GW will now remember if it was maximized when closed and will restore that status the next time it is opened.  Thanks Grant!</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Expect another release of GWC fairly soon with Notebooks and perhaps a little more. </p>
      <p><span class="BlogDate">7/27/11: Release 1.540</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Release 1.540 has several nifty new things:</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- There's a new Cut Depth Mini-Calculator for turning.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  The HSM calculator is slightly changed.    It no longer messes with SFM or Chipload--these are left as they were without HSM compensation.   Instead, correction factors are applied to RPM and Feedrate.  The amount of the multiplier for each is also now displayed in the calculator.  This makes it easier to enter custom SFM and Chipload based on manufacturer's tooling recommendations and then apply the HSM multiplier downstream.  Thanks to William for the suggestion!</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  If you select a particular Alloy and Condition from the Materials DB, your selection will now be displayed below the Materials drop down.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- You can run G-Wizard for up to 2 weeks without an Internet connection.  What's new in 1.540 is it will start to warn you 3 days in advance of when the 2 weeks runs out. This was based on feedback from customers who didn't want last minute hiccups with G-Wizard not running when they got in on a Monday.  3 days will let you know Friday to take care of it over the weekend if need be.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Your Cut Depth is now limited to be less than Stickout.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  The number of decimal places on feedrate is reduced when in metric--there were too many and it made it hard to read sometimes.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- We added a &quot;Made by CNCCookbook in America&quot; notice because we're proud of our roots.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">7/11/11: Release 1.53</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Release 1.53 has a number of customer-suggested changes as well as some work under the covers to prepare for bigger features that are coming.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Made a change so that manufacturer's data needs to be brought in via csv spreadsheet import. Manual editing within G-Wizard has been disabled. Over time, we've found it's just a lot easier and less error prone to edit the CSV sheets, so we're discontinuing support going forward for manual edits. For more information on the format of these sheets, see our <a href="GWCustTools.html">Manufacturer's Data Page</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug that could cause the default taper list to pop up empty sometimes for metric users.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Add unit conversion for the remaining fields on interpolation so they all show in metric.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- The drill chart now has options to select inch or metric endmill sizes.  This makes it easy to use the drill chart for setting endmill size.  Since it handles more than just twist drills, the button is now called &quot;Sizes&quot;.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  The old &quot;ballnose&quot; and &quot;parabolic&quot; check boxes have been changed to a single combo box that will be used to capture geometry options for tooling. At the moment, it only handles the ballnose on endmills and parabolic on twist drills, but this is how we'll handle a much larger variety of geometries in future releases.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  CSV import files used to only accept Imperial units. You now have the option to use metric on any column.  For columns normally in inches, just add &quot;-mm&quot; to the column name and it will be in millimeters. For surface speed (e.g. SFM), you can use &quot;-mpm&quot; for &quot;meters per minute.&quot; This should make dealing with manufacturer's tool data easier for metric users.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Made a number of changes to make the tool information import more robust with better error checking.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Made a usability improvement to Cut Optimizer so it has 3 radio buttons for the different options instead of 2 radio buttons and a checkbox--makes a lot more sense when you read it. Thanks Travis!</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- It was possible when calculating tapping feeds and speeds for the feedrate to get out of sync with the rpms, which is a sure way to break a tap.  I've now disabled overrides when tapping, and if the required feedrate is unavailable due to a limit, it will set the feedrate to &quot;0&quot; to signal there is a problem.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">6/13/11: Release 1.52</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Some really good stuff in 1.52:</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- We've added a Plunge Roughing mini-calculator.   Plunge Roughing is a very efficient roughing strategy for machines and setups where rigidity is a problem.  This calculator will be in Beta for a while so folks can validate the results.  I checked it against a number of online sources, and it seems conservative, if anything.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  We've taken the HSM constant tool engagement calculator out of beta--it's finalized now. The last step was to validate it not only with our own users, but with online data sources such as <a href="http://www.emastercam.com/board/index.php?showtopic=61779&pid=693122&st=0&#entry693122">this database on the eMastercam group</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- We now suggest a twist drill size to use with reamers in the hint area at the bottom of feeds and speeds.  This was a customer-suggested feature (thanks, John!).</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Another customer-suggested feature is the ability to select sheet metal gauges in the Weights and Volumes calculator.   You select a gauge from the popup list and this sets the material thickness for further calculations.  This also provides a handy reference for sheet metal thickness.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Added units to the hardware profile page to make it more obvious what to enter.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- We now have support for Through Spindle Coolant (TSC) and Programmable Coolant Nozzles (PCN) like <a href="http://www.spidercool.com/">SpiderCool</a> or <a href="http://atyourservice.haascnc.com/faaqs/machining-centers-programmable/">Haas P-Cool</a>. These can add a lot of productivity to a machining center, especially drilling holes.   To use the features, you must indicate they're enable for you machine on the machine profile (Setup tab).   You then access them with checkboxes just to the right of the mini-calcs.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a number of customer reported bugs and made other minor tweaks for usability and appearance.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">5/19/11: Release 1.51</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">This is a minor release that includes:</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Several bug fixes including improvements to the metric units handling around machine weights and rigidity adjustment.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Correction to data for M16 threads.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Added SA516 Group 70 to Low Carbon Steel.  This is a pressure vessel alloy.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">- Minor usability improvement: remember thread size when switching between internal and external threads.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">5/10/11: Release 1.5</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Version 1.5 of G-Wizard Calculator was just uploaded. I'm going to wait a few   days before I activate the upgrade notices to make sure there are no issues. </p>
<p class="BodyText1"> There's several new things in this release, but the main reason I'm being   cautious is there are code changes to the login to support our upcoming new   login server which should register new users and new subscribers faster. We   don't have the faster part working yet, but getting this out there is an   essential part of the process.<BR>
  <BR>
  Aside from the new login code, which ought   not to be noticeable unless you look really closely (it should be a little   faster as it transfers a lot less data to do its thing), we've added:<BR>
  <BR>
  - A   point angle tip based on materials that appears in feeds and speeds for Twist   Drills. This tip also suggests split points or cobalt (HP HSS) for tough   materials.<BR>
  <BR>
  - The Geometry calculator was updated to make it easy to   select standard twist drill point angles from a menu.<BR>
  <BR>
  - Several fixes to   bugs reported by customers.<BR>
  <BR>
  - Biggest news is a new "Electrical" tab   under Quick Reference. Machinists frequently have to deal with electrical   issues, if only to keep the machines running. Over time we'll add a number of   additional capabilities to this area. For now, we have an Ohm's Law calculator   and a resistor color code calculator.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">3/30/11: Release 1.045</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">It's been a little while since we had a new G-Wizard Calculator release, so this one is a doozy.</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><strong>G-Wizard gets a Gas Pedal</strong></p>
<p class="BodyText1">The biggest news is that G-Wizard got a Gas Pedal:</p>
<p align="center" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate"><img src="img/GWizard/GasPedal.jpg" width="800" height="716" alt="G-Wizard Gas Pedal"></span></p>
<p align="center" class="BodyText1">The G-Wizard Gas Pedal...</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">The Gas Pedal is the Tortoise and Hare gizmo at the bottom.  If you move it towards our conservative tortoise, it emphasizes tool life and surface finish.  If you haven't been machining very long and are trying to learn, this is a good position to start out in. If you move it to the right towards our aggressive hare, G-Wizard tries to emphasize Material Removal Rate.  The Gas Pedal has 4 positions.   Just so you know, G-Wizard before the Gas Pedal is position #3, which is the default.   So, there is one more aggressive position, and 2 less aggressive positions available on tap.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">What it's actually doing under the covers when it goes conservative is scaling back the chipload a lot and the surface speed a little.  Reasons to be conservative:</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  You're a beginner</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  You want to emphasize surface finish over MRR. Slowing down chipload a lot versus surface speed will give a nicer finish.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  You can't afford to break a tool, either because the tool is expensive, or because the workpiece is expensive and would be damaged.   Being conservative doesn't guarantee you won't break a tool, but it certainly helps.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Your using inexpensive tooling and machinery.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">Reasons to be aggressive:</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">- You know what you're doing</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  You've got good tooling, a solid machine, and a good CAM program generating your g-code</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">- You're ready to crank it up</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><strong>Small Machine Rigidity Compensation</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">As we all know, small machines just aren't as rigid as larger machines.  When I say small, I mean small--smaller than any commercial VMC out there. Small begins with any machine that weighs less than 3000lbs. Anything bigger ignores it. If you leave the weight set to 0, it gets ignored too. </p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">If you fill out the machine profile completely, but especially in the areas of weight and travels, G-Wizard will adjust your horsepower downward (and hence the aggressiveness of your cuts, which are HP limited) if your machine likely falls below normal VMC rigidity standards.  There is a checkbox next to the weight field on the Machine Profile (first Setup tab) that tells what it is derated to.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">The Small Machine compensation takes into account that with smaller machines, not all of the weight goes to rigidity. After all, that motor sitting atop the spindle head isn't making things more rigid, nor are the servos or steppers hanging off the sides of the axes.    The smaller the machine, the more it assumes there is &quot;non-rigidity increasing weight.&quot;  </p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">In addition, it takes into account travels. There is a sweet spot envelope for each weight class that maximizes the rigidity. Expanding travels beyond that point penalizes the rigidity, even though it makes the machine a little heavier.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">These rigidity compensation calculations are by necessity approximations.   We don't have your machine available to do Finite Elements Analysis on.  But, based on data collected from a lot of machines, we think it will help folks with small machines to operate more within the limits of those machines and hence be more successful.   If you've got everything dialed in and don't need the help, by all means turn off the rigidity compensation by clicking the checkbox next to the weight field.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><strong>Rigid Fixture or Machine Bonus Comp</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">For the opposite end of the spectrum from small machines with minimal rigidity there is a new combo box between the &quot;Feedrate&quot; and the &quot;Simplify/Advanced&quot; button.  It has two choices: Normal and Rigid.   Use the &quot;Rigid&quot; choice advisedly to boose your speeds and feeds.  If you have a particularly beefy machine, perhaps a big solid Mori Seiki or most Horizontal mills compared to most Vertical mills, flip it over to &quot;Rigid&quot;.  If your fixturing is particularly solid, you can flip over to &quot;Rigid&quot;.     What we're looking for are above average machines and setups to take advantage of this feature to drive higher speeds and feeds.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><strong>Chatter Pitch Calculator</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">So you hit some chatter and it's leaving noticeable marks on your workpiece. Consider this an opportunity, because now you can calculate the speed to run your spindle to minimize that chatter.  It's easy with the G-Wizard Chatter Pitch Calculator:</p>
<p align="center" class="BodyText1"><img src="img/GWizard/ChatterPitch.jpg" width="800" height="663" alt="Chatter Pitch Calculator"></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">To use the Chatter Pitch Calculator, you must be able to see the chatter marks on your workpiece well enough to measure the distance between them. Enter that value in the top choice.   Enter your surface speed (SFM) you were using when you made the cut, and lastly, enter how many flutes your cutter has. The Chatter Pitch Calculator will them recommend a series of spindle speeds that will minimize that chatter frequency.  It recommends some speeds that are faster than where chatter occured, and some that are slower. </p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"> In the example screen shot, the chatter marks are extremely close together, implying a very high frequency.  Most real cases will involve much lower chatter frequencies, and hence much lower spindle speeds would be recommended.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">Here is why it is an opportunity, whenever you can quantify chatter like this.  So long as you keep the same type of toolholder, same type of tool, the same tool stickout (be sure to measure and record it!), this chatter frequency will be reproduced regardless of the workpiece and fixturing. That means that for this tooling combination, you've now found a set of spindle rpm ranges that should be relatively chatter free, hence you can run quite a bit faster in those.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><strong>Coating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">When you select most carbide tools, G-Wizard will indicate what the recommended coatings are for the material being machined.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><strong>Web Site URL's</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">We've had several shops request information on what URL's G-Wizard accesses so they can keep their firewalls tightly focused on only allowing access to known URL's.  To facilitate this, the Setup Files tab now lists the URL's that G-Wizard is accessing.  It does standard HTTP operations on these URL's, so no additional ports are needed other than what is used by a web browser.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">Several customer reported bugs were fixed:</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Some errors in the taper data. Also add data for 5C and R8 tapers.</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Fixed a bug accessing the unit conversion popups for the scientific calculator.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">3/12/11: Release 1.041</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Bug fixes and a few minor features and refinements:</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Additional low-carbon steels added to the Material DB:  A36, A569, A1011.   </p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Added an acceleration field to the hardware profile.  This field is used as the default acceleration in the Interpolation Mini-Calc.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">-  Some metric refinements for the cut optimizer.  There were a couple values (power and MRR) that didn't switch to Metric, and the default deflection values for Roughing and Finishing have been changed to be friendlier &quot;round&quot; numbers when in metric.  Thanks for the suggestions, Scott!</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">2/25/11: Release 1.040</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Check out the new Ramping and Interpolation Mini-Calcs. They're very cool!  They're documented on the <a href="GWCalcFeedsSpeeds.htm">Feeds and Speeds doc page</a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">I added default profiles for the Tormach PCNC 1100 since we have so many Tormach users as well as the IHCNC mill.  The specs for VMC were changed to be the specs of a current Haas VF-1 and Lathe is a Haas TL-1.  Unfortunately, you can't get at them unless you're starting with a clean install and no preferences files. Eventually you'll be able to download profile information from our &quot;Cloud&quot; like you do Tooling and CNC Controller profiles for the editor. </p>
<p class="BodyText1">Numerous bug fixes and tweaks based on customer feedback. For example, there was a bug that would cause multiple copies of some popup windows to appear. Another that was annoying caused the selected machine profile to revert to &quot;VMC&quot; if you shut down with the Setup page showing.</p>
<p><span class="BlogDate">2/21/11: Release 1.039</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">Some fixes of various kinds and a new &quot;Tips&quot; feature.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">The software will nag trial users less often, ands shows a Tip window instead.  Subscribers get the tip window too.  You can go through all the tips in the window with a button if you like.  You can also turn tips off with a check box in the Tip window.  To turn them back on, there is a checkbox on Setup About.      </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">2/16/11: Release 1.037</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">Tweaks and bug fixes coming out of the Manufacturer's Tool Data crowd sourcing exercise.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">2/15/11: Release 1.036</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">Quite a lot of additional bulletproofing for Tool Table Import added in this release.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">2/14/11: Release 1.033</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">Unplanned minor release. Fixes a bug and adds the ability to import tool tables as CSV files. Export one to see what the format should look like.  Various folks are playing with these formats in order to be able to connect to their CAM program, Mach3, or other software.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">2/11/11: Release 1.032</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">Couple of items to help some customers:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Under Quick Reference there is a new tab &quot;Thermal&quot; that has a thermal expansion calculator.   Useful to tell how much your parts (or potentially your machine and tooling) may move with temperature changes.  I've written a brief description for the <a href="GWCalcQuickRef.htm">Quick Ref docs</a> of how it can be used.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Added new entries to the Material DB for A514 and T1 under &quot;Steel - Low Carbon Alloy (<span class="BodyText">8620)&quot;.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Added an import button on the Custom Inserts / Tooling popup for the Tool Crib so it is handy to download more manufacturer's data.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">2/1/11: Release 1.031</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- First cut of a new facility to directly download manufacturer's information into G-Wizard is available. Visit the Tool Crib and click the Import button to see the catalog.   You can also still import the CSV files locally via a button on the catalog popup.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Added additional error checking as well as error logging to help diagnose problems in the field.   There is a new &quot;Log&quot; button below the About box that will bring up the error log. Ordinarily, it should be empty.   If you are having a problem, I may ask you to email me whatever is reported there.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  The Export button now includes a variable for ballnose in the data it puts in the clipboard or saves to a file.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">1/30/11: Release 1.029</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Added &quot;Plunge&quot; and &quot;Ramp&quot; cut types to Cut KB.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Added the ability to control your upgrade notifications. There are three choices:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Immediate: Notify immediately of any new release availability.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Feathered:  You will be notified from 1 to 7 days after a new release is available.  This has been the default.  It gives time for any obvious bugs to be discovered before everyone upgrades.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Severe:  Only mandatory upg<span class="BodyText">rades are flagged.  You'll miss a lot of upgrades this way as I don't mark very many as mandatory.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- The Feeds and Speeds drill chart popup now scrolls to the current tool diameter (or closest to it) on popup.  You can double click a drill to close the popup and enter that drill's diameter.  Thanks KVOM for the suggestions!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a bug where changing IPR in the surface finish calculator for lathe was not saving back to Feeds and Speeds.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Fixed a roundoff bug that would cause the cut optimizer to periodically announce it couldn't find a solution even though it had.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">- Manufacturer's data is now release and not beta.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">-  Renamed &quot;Setup Other&quot; tab to be &quot;Setup Integrate&quot;.  There are a whole host of new options there to be used to facilitate integration with CAM programs. These are probably not real useful to end users until the CAM program integrations are finished, though you can make it easy to copy Feeds and Speeds data to Excel.</p>

      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">1/18/11: Release 1.025</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Final installment on Cut KB UI mockups (except for Chatter tab, which will be down the road).</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Several new custom tool data files are <a href="GWCustTools.html">available for download</a>:</p>

      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- Bug fixes. Be sure to pick up this release if you're using the custom tool data, as some of the new data won't import without the bug fixes.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">1/13/11: Release 1.024</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- New additions to the materials database: </p>
<p class="BodyText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steels--1108, 1109, 1115, 1120, 1126, 1132, 1139, 1144, 1146, 1151.</p>

      <p class="BodyText">-  Add Cut KB Entry mock-up now includes rating stars so you can rate the desirability of the cut.  This provides 4 ways of quantifying the Cut KB Entry:    Rating (0-5 stars), Comment, Wear, and Chatter.</p>
      <p class="BodyText">-  Did some serious work on the Cut KB UI layout to try to get the most important stuff to the top left and to make it overall look better.   These screens are somewhat complex as is Feeds and Speeds.  There's just a whole lot going on there!</p>
<p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">12/30/10: Release 1.023</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">1.023 has a bug fix for the cut optimizer. It was not optimizing though the deflection values on the feeds and speeds page were accurate. The optimizer now also figures the deflection allowance based on cutter diameter for very small cutters as 0.001&quot; was too much for a micro mill.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">12/22/10: Release 1.022</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">1.022 has a bug fix for the cascading menu HSS/Carbide tools--they weren't updating when material was changed. It also has a feature to export the spindle rpm and feedrate when a button is pressed.  A customer is experimenting with some scripts that make it easier to integrate G-Wizard with their CAM system.  This export feature is off by default and should be considered experimental. Contact us before you start depending on it!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">12/18/10: Release 1.020</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">1.020 was almost 3 weeks in the making, so it's a big release.   There may be some bugs as a result.      If you need to revert to the prior version due to a bug, there is a link right under the install button on the <a href="GWizard/GWizardInstall1SC.html">GW Install Page</a>.  Be sure to report the problem either via <a href="mailto:sales@cnccookbook.com">email</a> or the <a href="http://cnccookbook.proboards.com/index.cgi">User's Club</a> so it can be fixed!</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">The major new functionality is Custom Tool Data.   Docs are already up on the <a href="GWCalcSetup.htm">Setup page</a>. This feature allows you to enter your manufacturer's recommendations for surface speed (SFM) and chipload (IPT) for a particular tool.  You enter these values by material and by diameter for chipload.  You need not enter every possible material or chipload for every diameter.  You'll need to do at least one material and at least either one chipload value for a diameter or a surface speed.   With that said, it's worthwhile to at least fill out all the entries for a material so you have them for future use while the data is handy.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">You can also enter Custom Tool Data by importing a comma separated file (Excel will create these).    We will be building a library of these files as we get in information.   See the details on the <a href="GWCustTools.html">Tool Data Download Page</a>.  We recommend you create your tool data as csv files rather than directly in G-Wizard.     The reason is that the file is reusable and easier to see and work with in Excel.   Plus, if you send us your csv files, we'll add them to the library.  </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">Other Changes:</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  The Tool Menu now cascades to show HSS or Carbide on less commonly used tools.    Commonly used tools still have both entries at the top level to save keystrokes.  Tools that used to use a checkbox to signify carbide (Taps and Saws) will need to be reconfigured in the Tool Crib using the new menu.   This gives us some new carbide choices that were not in prior versions, such as Carbide Spade Drills.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">- The Tool Menu is now scrollable for times when you're accessing a Tool Crib with a lot of entries.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a bug in figuring weights and volumes for Tubing.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Made quite a few changes to the surface finish popup for turning tools.  You can now enter nose radius directly, but the menu is still available to select standard radii.  In addition, the popup will remember the nose radius for the duration of the G-Wizard session (but will reset if you exit) so you don't have to keep re-entering it.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Fixed some serious bugs in the Preferences backup code.   In some cases it would save all the preferences as a single file instead of writing a set of files.   If you've been backing up your Preferences (always a good idea), you should be sure to take a new backup with this release.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Fixed a bug reported on the User's Club where chamfer diameter was always in inches.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Quite a few fit and finish detail changes in various areas of the Tool Crib.  For example, I tried to make sure the &quot;Delete&quot; buttons had some whitespace around them so they are harder to accidentally click.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">-  Added some Nitralloy entries to the Materials DB.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">11/30/10: Release 1.010</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">The big news for 1.010 is the new HSM function on the Feeds and Speeds. It can   be used to figure estimated cutter engagement angles and to adjust feeds and   speeds for cornering, or when constant tool engagement toolpaths (e.g. Surfcam   and similar CAM) are available. I'll be writing up more documentation for it   shortly and will post a note. <BR>
        <BR>
        For now, consider it experimental (hence   it is labeled "Beta"), but the results agree pretty well with published HSM   feeds and speeds I've taken a look at. Being able to characterize cutter   engagement angles (also called tool engagement angle or TEA) is another important step for a potent Cutting Knowledge   Base.<BR>
        <BR>
        Here are the other more minor changes in 1.010:<BR>
        <BR>
        - Minor   readability improvements in Feeds and Speeds.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Stickout is now available   for drills and taps per user request.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Added a couple of new holder   types to the Cut KB mock-up.<BR>
        <BR>
        - Added code to make it possible to suppress   the fancy burning metal logo for a simpler one. Burning metal apparently crashes   the software on some older Macs.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">11/23/10: Release 1.009</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">The main thing here is a UI mockup of the upcoming Cut KB feature. If you go to   the Feeds and Speeds page, you'll see a new button at the bottom "Cut   KB".<BR>
        <BR>
        Click it and you'll see a screen popup. The purpose of the screen is   to gather up all the information needed to make another entry to the Cut   KB.<BR>
        <BR>
        A few remarks on all the many parameters:<BR>
        <BR>
        Description: I   wanted to get this right up front and obvious. <BR>
        <BR>
        Tool Definition: This box   doesn't let you edit much. Your tool definition should be set from Feeds and   Speeds. I just copy it over in the form of an English description you can't   edit. Why not make it editable? This page is way too busy already, so I only let   you edit things that are not already edited elsewhere. There is a mocked up   adjustment for SFM and Chipload. Of course the purpose of the Cut KB is to have   you bump thoes up over time to see how far you can push the envelope and then   record the result.<BR>
        <BR>
        Use: These are important parameters about how the tool   is used that may change its performance. In particular, we track the stickout,   type of holder, and type of coolant you've used.<BR>
        <BR>
        Cut Type: Different cut   types have varying degrees of challenge. By tracking them, you can individually   tune your Cut KB for each case. There is also a box to track Rough/Finish, and   your depths of cut.<BR>
        <BR>
        TEA: "TEA" stands for "Tool Engagement Angle".   Devotees of HSM (High Speed Machining) will understand what that means. For   others, consider it to be a measure of how severe the corners are. Corners can   radically increase the load on a tool, and make for a more challenging toolpath.   Some CAM packages can produce constant TEA toolpaths with blinding speeds. We   want to record that. The "Est. TEA" will be a popup that provides very rough   estimates of the TEA of your part based on your inputs.<BR>
        <BR>
        Material: Of   course we capture the material and its hardness, as well as some notes. Many   machinists report that the same material from different suppliers machines   different. The Notes box is your chance to keep up with that.<BR>
        <BR>
        Comments: I   wanted a big Comments box where you can note anything missing in a complete   description for your Cut KB. <BR>
        <BR>
        Chatter: This is a rating of Chatter from 0   (None) to 5 (Bad!). By keeping up with which cuts resulted in chatter, we can   over time build a stability lobe diagram and predict how to avoid the chatter   for much higher performance cutting.<BR>
        <BR>
        As I say, this is just a mockup. I'm   looking for any feedback you may have. Let me know if there are particular   variables that should be in a Cut KB that I have missed, for example. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"><span class="BlogDate">11/21/10: Release 1.008</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">Just two areas of change. First, the Files tab under Setup was overhauled to   make it easy to backup and restore your setup preferences. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1"> Second, I   added some new entries to the Materials DB per user requests. These were   primarily in the area of new aluminums such as 2219.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText1">If you are ever   looking for a material and can't find it, send me a note.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText"><span class="BlogDate">11/16/10: Release 1.007</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="BodyText">This is a bug fix release. There was a display problem on the Twist Drill   geometry calculator where it showed a scroll bar on the diameter.<BR>
        <BR>
        A   couple of minor additions:<BR>
        <BR>
        1. I am overhauling the Preferences facility   to accomodate the large number of Preferences needed by the Editor. As part of   that effort, the Files tab under Setup is slightly improved. You can now grab   the directories into the clipboard if you need to get to them. A little later I   will add functionality to make it easy to backup and restore all the preferences   to any directory you like. This should make managing or sharing them   easier.<BR>
        <BR>
        2. I had a customer request a new material be added to the   Materials DB. It's a very cool Copper Berryllium alloy used by the mold industry   that is called MoldMax. <BR>
        <BR>
        Any time you need a material that isn't in the   materials database I am happy to add it so long as you can provide me with a web   link that includes information on the alloy, conditions, and hardnesses. Feel   free to drop me a line and ask, just like it says on the popup.<BR>
        <BR>
        Other   than that annoying bug with twist drills, I would have waited for this release,   but there you go.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">11/12/10: Release 1.006</p>
      <p class="BodyText1">Version 1.006 is now up. It has the remainder of the Materials database uploaded   and some fine tuning here and there. </p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">11/10/10: Release 1.005</p>
      <p class="BodyText">Ver 1.005 brings more materials online for the new materials model introduced   with Ver 1.004. We started with just aluminum and 1.005 adds:<BR>
        <BR>
        -   Brass<BR>
        - Copper Alloys (Bronze)<BR>
        - Cast Iron<BR>
        - Nickel and its Alloys<BR>
        -   Magnesium Alloys<BR>
        - Plastics<BR>
        - Stainless Steel<BR>
        <BR>
        What's left are the   many non-stainless flavors of steel plus titanium alloys. All in all, it's   probably half done. <BR>
        <BR>
        Still some fine tuning to be done in all likelihood.   There are also some bug fixes in 1.005.<BR>
        <BR>
        Lastly, the material db only   worked with carbide tooling in 1.004, while 1.005 works for the HSS tools now   too.<BR>
        <BR>
        If you're messing with the Material DB, you should definitely pick   up 1.005.</p>
      <p align="left" class="BlogDate">11/9/10: Release 1.004</p>
      <p><span class="BodyText"><strong>New Material Model</strong>: A greatly expanded and much more comprehensive   Material Model is coming. What the new model does is two things. First, a lot of   folks had trouble indentifying how to map their particular material into the   broad categories of the old model. They wanted more exact names for the various   alloys. <BR>
        <BR>
        Second, there is a pretty wide range of hardnesses on some of   those categories, and that can affect the SFM to an interesting degree. GW had   to err on the conservative side as a result. It assumed you were on the low side   of the middle of the hardness range and then some.<BR>
        <BR>
        With the new model,   you can still use the old categories (fewer of them so it can be faster), or you   can press the "More" button just to the right of the old Material menu and get   the new model. Tell it the family (it'll pull that from the old menu or you can   change it), and then check the list for your particular alloy and its condition.   Hit "OK" or double click it when you get the one you want.<BR>
        <BR>
        That's all   there is to it. You may also indicate a hardness if you know it for your   particular material. <BR>
        <BR>
        Limitations: We've only got cast and wrought   aluminum so far. I'll be working my way through nearly every category before I'm   done, so the final Material database will be huge. But I wanted to expose you   all to the new model in case there was feedback before I invest further effort   in it. Also, it is only correct when using Carbide. It will swing the values too   far for HSS.<BR>
        <BR>
        Consider it experimental!<BR>
        <BR>
        <strong>Slitting Saws and   Woodruff Cutters</strong>: Got a new tool type--last thing on the menu for mills. I   had a lot of requests (Thanks Kent, et al) for slitting saws and woodruff   cutters, so hopefully this helps. Take note of the labels, as a couple change.   For example, Cut Depth is now the saw blade thickness while Cut Width is how   deep a cut you're making in a single pass. <BR>
        <BR>
        The depth of cut triggers a   required pitch calculation to try to force coarser pitches on deeper cuts so   there is sufficient gullet room to clear chips. You may see a hint telling you   some number of teeth is recommended. If so, you probably should go to a coarser   pitch blade. It will automatically slow down the feeds to try to   compensate.<BR>
        <BR>
        <strong>Machine Memory</strong>: GW nows remembers the last machine   profile you had selected from one session to the next--thanks   Bevin!<BR>
        <BR>
        <strong>Keyboard Nav</strong>: You can now switch between GW applets by   pressing Alt+&lt;first letter of app name&gt;. So Alt-F is Feeds and Speeds,   Alt-C is Calculator, etc.<BR>
        <BR>
        <strong>Micro-Machining Chiploads</strong>: When you get   a really small cutter, less than 0.100" in diameter, you get an extra digit of   IPT accuracy per user suggestion. I've got several folks out there working with   really tiny cutters and reporting good results. That makes me happy because   unlike many calculators, GW uses an entirely new algorithm for these cutters   since the physics change quite a bit at those scales.</span></p>

        <li class="BodyText1">Tool Types are re-ordered on the menu to put the more commonly used tools first--endmills for mills and turning tools for lathes.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Fixed behavior of Cut Optimizer when you keep pressing the Optimize button multiple times. Also, since   it runs Optimize automatically when it comes up, Cut Optimizer doesn't enable the Optimize button unless you change a parameter.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">User Club button added.</li>

        <li class="BodyText1">This is a more minor release than the last one: mostly polish and detail level fixes as we make our way into Final Beta Test.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Bug fixes were largely in the areas of metric support and the tool crib.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Added a &quot;Slot&quot; field to the Tool Crib so you can indicate which tool changer slot each tool is in.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Added a command to move tools between Tool Cribs. This way you can have a crib for each tool changer, one for the tooling cart that goes with each machine, and one for your Tool Crib. By moving the tools, you can maintain crude inventory control. Eventually, more features will be added along these lines, but not in G-Wizard 1.0.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">There is a new &quot;About&quot; tab under the Setup app that tells you what version of the software you're running.  This is version 0.801.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Added carbide spot drills.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Refinements to the micro-mill support so it meshes more smoothly with normal sized cutters.</li>
        <li class="BodyText1">Initial work done to allow compensation when dry machining. Nothing you can see yet, the finished feature will be in the next release after this one.</li>

        <li class="BodyText">Add the ability to type a &quot;d&quot; in the relevant fields of Feeds and Speeds so you can access the Tool's diameter. For example, to make the depth of cut 1/3 of the tool diameter, just enter &quot;d*33%&quot; in the field.  (Prompted by a Customer suggestion, though not exactly what he was hoping for. More coming!)</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added <a href="GWCalcGeometry.htm">Diametral True Position</a>.  (Customer prompted, thanks Mike!)</li>

        <li class="BodyText">Fixed a screen res issue that prevented use of the Threads tool on lower resolution netbooks. (Customer prompted)</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Modified the Tool Crib display to use checkmarks instead of True/False for ballnose and rougher to make it easier to read. (Customer suggestion, thanks Steve!)</li>
        <li class="BodyText">As always, a number of bug fixes for problems I found as well as problems reported by customers.</li>

      <ul>
        <li class="BodyText">New TiAlN endmill type added that is more aggressive than the HP Carbide Endmill for most materials.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">New Files tab under setup can be used to find your preferences file directory and to reset Preferences, Machine Profiles, or Tool Crib to their defaults.    Be careful because reseting deletes any changes you made!</li>
        <li class="BodyText">There is a new Turner's Cube calculator under the Geometry tab.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">There is a new Hardness conversion table under the Quick Reference tab.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">A lot of work was done in this release to allow the upcoming G-Code editor to share the Tool Crib and Machine Profiles with the Calculator, so keep an eye on these areas for problems.  This work is probably 70% of the way done.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">A number of problems associated with metric use were fixed or improved.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Whenever any of the various limits are hit in Feeds and Speeds (e.g. HP Limit, Feedrate Limit, etc.), the limit and the actual parameter that is limited change colors to orange to let you know the limit was reached.</li>

        <li class="BodyText">Improved metric handling of spindle power and feedrates for machine profiles.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Selecting a machine type (even indirectly by choosing a machine profile with a different type) now changes the contents of the Tool menu. For example, lathes have turning and mills have boring tools.</li>

        <li class="BodyText">Made some improvements to the various screens for people running 1024x768 resolution.   You can at least access both Internal and External threads now.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Note that the update link is wrong in the prior version, fixed in this version. Unfortunately it means you'll need to navigate to the <a href="GWizard/GWizardInstall1SC.html">update page</a> manually.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added tool tips on the feeds and speeds calculator.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added the #4.5 center drill size.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">Added a G and M-code reference page.</li>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chamfering with a countersink now uses the dimension of the tip flat.</font></li>
        <li class="BodyText"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most fields now accept an &quot;i&quot; or &quot;m&quot; after a number (similar to Gibbscam) to facilitate entering alternate units. For example, suppose you are running G-Wizard in Imperial (inches) and you want to enter 8mm as the diameter of a twist drill.  Simply enter 8m and it will be converted to 0.315&quot;.</font>   The override fields (padlocks) don't yet accept this notation.</li>
        <li class="BodyText">If you have registered recently, you'll know that there is now an<a href="FeedSpeedsCalculator/CCGWizard.html"> online registration page</a>. You no longer have to send me an email!</li>

        and some color changes were made to increase contrast.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed some bugs in Degree 
          mode in the calculator. </font></li>

      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added chipload adjustments 
          for micro-machining (cutters less than 1/16&quot; diameter) per <a href="http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/how-do-you-get-the-cutting-parameters-right-for-small-end-mills">guidelines 
          by Makino's head of micro-machining R&amp;D.</a> </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed a bug in metric mode: 
          could not enter a full width cut on Feeds and Speeds.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upgrade to Adobe Flex 3.4 
          SDK. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Improved Feeds and Speeds 
          info for reamers: Now it only shows IPR, not IPT. Also gives the material 
          allowance (hole size) for reaming.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added SFM and Chipload adjustment 
          factors to Tool Crib. This lets you adjust a specific tool to have a 
          high or lower SFM (by a % factor) than G-Wizard recommends.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smoother interpolation for 
          cut widths when calculating feeds and speeds. It was a bit jumpy in 
          places.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed a bug when computing 
          minutes per pass with drills. They needed to use the hole depth rather 
          than pass length.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Improved implementation 
          of HP limits. Originally, they just backed off feedrate. Now it backs 
          off SFM by up to 20% before starting on feedrate. This will improve 
          tool life.</font></li>

          by 1/16&quot; in Imperial and 0.5mm in metric in a lot of places when 
          you click on their arrows. Before they moved by 0.0001, which was not 
          convenient.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added an &quot;Angle&quot; 
          column to the bolt circle calculator.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Tuned down the chipload 
          with steel on HSS endmills. It was a little aggressive for cheaper endmills.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plunge rate for endmills 
          now takes into account the number of flutes the cutter has, which means 
          it will feed more slowly than it used to with cutters that have more 
          than 2 flutes.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Made the interpolation of

          milling in any event.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added thread cut depths 
          to the Threads Quick Reference tab. These depths tell lathe users at

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Made degrees and radians

          data.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First metric support has

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spent the evening adding 
          functions for Twist Drills. G-Wizard now handles parabolic bits (just 
          select a Twist Drill and click the &quot;Parabolic&quot; check box to 
          tell it you have one), and will automatically slow feeds and speeds 
          for deep holes as well as recommend when you need to peck drill, and 
          when you should be using a parabolic. If it says &quot;Not Recommended&quot;, 
          you're trying to drill too deep a hole in all likelihood.</font></li>

          on the calculator. Press the &quot;Frac.&quot; button to add a fractional 
          amount to the current value. For example, enter a &quot;1&quot;, press 
          &quot;Frac.&quot;, click &quot;1/2&quot;, and the calculator now displays 
          &quot;1.5&quot;. In addition, the &quot;Frac.&quot; button will display 
          the fraction any time the calculator display is within a tenth of any 
          1/32. So enter &quot;0.375&quot; and the button's label changes to read 
          &quot;3/8&quot;. This makes it easy for you to deal with fractions.</font></li>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Per a suggestion by Widgitmaster, 
          I have added a True Precision calculator, which may be found under the 
          &quot;Geometry&quot; function. True Precision is a Geometric Tolerance 
          concept. It is the square root of each of the error components squared. 
          In other words, it is the Euclidean distance of the error. To make room 
          for &quot;True Precision&quot;, I moved &quot;Areas and Volumes&quot;
