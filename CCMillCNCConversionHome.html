      <p class="BlogTitle">Limit/Home Switch Noise</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">I recently got my <a href="CCMillCNCHomeSwitches.htm">Home Switches</a> going and decided to go ahead and enable them to act as limit switches too. That's when I became aware of just how much noise there was on the lines.  I was getting a gratuitous limit fault from noise about every 2 to 3 minutes.    No worries, I did what I should have done to start and grounded the foil inside my cables to the CNC electronics cabinet via their connector. The noise went away immediately and life has been good since.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">If you didn't think you had much <a href="CCCNCNoise.html">noise in your system</a>, maybe its because you didn't have a way to check? Ground the cables at the electronics cabinet end (not the machine end, that can create ground loops).</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Mach3 Users: Make all of your Accelerations the Same on your Axes!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">I discovered this was a problem while making my tapping arms.  Due to the high rate of feed (50 IPM) and some abrupt changes of direction to follow the profile, I hadn't really encountered the problem before.   I had heard on one individual having an issue with wildly different motor tuning on a knee versus his X and Y axis.    It had been said this was a bug in Mach.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">In any event, as I discovered early in my machining of the axis arms, it isn't a good idea to have different accelerations on two axes.   I wouldn't have noticed it had it not been for easing back the accel on the X axis because it was faulting too much when I run with two 6&quot; vises on the table.  I lowered the X axis accel to match the Z and forgot about it.   This latest job making a tapping arm reminded me in short order that something needed tending to. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">It seems odd to me that Mach3 doesn't account for this, and it ought to be classified as a bug. Mach's trajectory planner should be able to properly choreograph a coordinated move across n-axes with a different acceleration and top velocity on each.    If nothing else, the lazy algorithm would simply limit all the coordinated axes to the least acceleration and velocity of any axis involved at the time.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">In any event, if you think you're doing yourself a favor by finding each axis's maximum performance envelope, you might in fact be doing the opposite until Mach learns to deal with it better.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">BTW, the symptom will be that the tool follows the coordinated move's path in a very sloppy way.    Going around the pivot point on the tapping arm swing block it was painfully obvious to the naked eye something was wrong--no calipers or micrometers needed.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Finally: Home and Limit Switches</p>
      <p class="style31">Full details on the <a href="CCMillCNCHomeSwitches.htm">Home Switch page</a>.</p>

      <p class="BlogDate">4/11/10</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Machine Tuning as Preventative Maintenance</p>
      <p class="style31">I like to fiddle a bit with my machines every now and again to make sure they're adjusted to tip top condition.  The CNC mill seems to benefit from this the most.      For example, the gibbs and sometimes the<span class="style11"> Mach3 motor tuning parameters benefit from periodic adjustment.     Perhaps surprisingly, the tuning varies depending on conditions.</span></p>
      <p class="style11">When its cold (like it is right now in my area), the mill is stiffer and seems to require lighter settings.  When I load the table with two 6&quot; Kurt vises there is enough weight to slow it down too.  Right now I have the combination of both, so things are kind of &quot;worst case&quot;, at least until I decide to throw a cylinder block up on the table and try to machine on that!</p>
      <p class="style11">In addition, Z is the most sensitive (being the heaviest), followed by X, followed by Y.</p>
      <p class="style11">So my current settings, which I regard as a worst case, are as follows:</p>
      <p class="style11">X  110 IPM, 10 acceleration<br>
        Y   120 IPM, 15 acceleration<br>
        Z   110 IPM, 10 acceleration</p>
      <p class="style11">I generally just leave Z right where it is.  However, if the weather is warm and the table is lightly loaded, I may bump X up to 120 and 15.</p>
      <p class="style11">It's concievable things can be made to run faster, but I like to keep my gibs very tight as well.  BTW, they sometimes need readjusting too.  The original owner of IH, Aaron Moss, once told me he retuned his gibbs every season.   I can definitely believe that.</p>
      <p class="style11">Something else that helps is a machine warmup.   When I get my <a href="CCMillCNCHomeSwitches.htm">home switches</a> finished, I will write a machine warmup program.  The idea is to move the axes through their full range of travel for a period of time, and warm up the spindle bearings as well.      This practice is common on full-sized VMC's, and there is no reason it wouldn't be helpful for my little mill too.    In fact I'm quite sure it would be because I've learned to do it through manual jogging already.       It would be even nicer to have a program run while I pump the oiler every so often to make sure plenty of way oil is being spread over all the surfaces.</p>

        Done!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm writing this in September, 
        having realized I never declared the mill done. I just got busy making 
        things with it. As near as I can tell, it was finished sometime in May. 
        My last work involved trying to get it all <a href="CCMillCNCTuneup.htm">dialed 
        in to be as accurate as possible</a>, one of the last aspects of that 
        was squaring the column, so I'm going to use that as my reference for 
        calling the job done. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I squared my mill column a 
        few weekends ago as part of an accurizing process I'm going through on 
        the mill, but I only just took the pix off the camera and processed them 
        today. I used a cylindrical square to measure how far off I was, leveled 
        the table, and then shimmed the mill column to take care of the remaining 
        error until I was just a few tenths off. The details are on my <a href="CCMillTipsTechniques.htm">Mill

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can see the 
        righthand 40% of the ballscrew is qutie a bit more accurate than the left, 
        although the first maybe 10% on the left is quite good too. Nevertheless, 
        the whole screw moves to well under a thousandth of accuracy. You can 
        also see that the errors are not cumulative, but are more periodic. The 
        total error in 24 inches of motion was 5.6 thousandths and the screws 
        are advertised as having less than 3 thou per 12&quot;, so this screw

        HEDS On Straight...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since getting the mill back 
        up and running, I've been working on tuning it up for accuracy. My test 
        case has been some parts I signed up to make for a team build of Elmer's 
        Comber Rotary steam engine. I've touched and tuned a lot of different 
        things, and I'll write up the tuning process at some point as a coherent 
        page. Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on one thing I did that made quite a 
        difference.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=73251&amp;page=4">Mariss 
        F. has been saying that there is a problem with servos that use HEDS encoders</a>. 
        These are the usual cheap US Digital encoders, and they're exactly what 
        I have in my homeshopcnc servos. Some folks have said they had no problem 
        with their encoders, others have said they have all kinds of problem. 
        Mariss proposed a fix that involves some simple bypass capacitors, so 
        I took it on myself to install the capacitors on my servos. Here is what 
        it takes:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's what 
        the innards look like. The HEDS encoder is connected by a simple little 
        harness...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Servos/P1011075.JPG" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We're bypassing 
        the power supply to filter out noise, so the capacitor goes between pins 
        1 (Gnd) and 4 (+5V)...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Servos/P1011076.JPG" width="800" height="655"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The easiest 
        thing is just to bend the capacitor leads, insert into the connector, 
        and then reinstall...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ceramic 1uF 
        capacitor goes across the HEDS power supply terminals at the encoder. 
        Use Digikey BC1151CT-ND capacitors. They cost $1.80 for a package of 10 
        pieces and Digikey was happy to send them to me without requiring a minimum 
        order.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The result? I 
        immediately noticed my servos were quieter when not moving--less dithering. 
        Some odd glitches and faults that would happen every now and again while 
        jogging went away. Best of all, my part was suddenly being more accurately 
        made--I was getting some false feedback from the encoder due to noise.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a quick 
        and easy fix: highly recommended if you have HEDS encoders!</font></p>

        the Mill is Back Up and Running!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That power surge was really 
        painful, but I finally got the mill running again on all 3 axes late last 
        weekend. Turns out I had blown the Smoothstepper and 2 out of the 3 Geckodrives. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having gotten the 2 drives 
        and Smoothstepper replaced, the worst part was just figuring out what 
        was wrong. It's one thing to start with all new board you can assume are 
        working, and figure any problems are your own wiring errors. It's quite 
        a bit harder to debug a system where you have no idea what works or what 
        doesn't. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having gotten the axes nominally 
        going, my next task was to tune each axis. Servos have to be tuned. I 
        followed a manual &quot;by ear&quot; tuning process first, and then went 
        back and checked on that result with my oscilloscope. Full details are 
        on <a href="CCServoTuning.htm">my servo tuning page</a>, but here are 
        a few photos I snapped for your enjoyment:</font></p>

        head, so about half this much acceleration is available...</font></p>

      <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did not get 
        a chance yet to see what kind of rapids are possible. My tuning was focused 
        on acceleration as it is a more difficult (and many advise more useful) 
        performance characteristic to optimize. I was pretty happy with the results, 
        but I intend to &quot;detune&quot; (back off slightly) in order to provide 
        a margin for error.</font>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Tough Week 
          for CNC Electronics: Smoothstepper Lost to Storm</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Man, it has been a tough 
          week. I wanted to do some more chip cutting this weekend. Seems we had 
          a big storm and it blew the power all over town. I didn't think much 
          of it, and I was not even running the CNC machine at the time. However, 
          I went down to the shop this morning expecting to dive in and discovered 
          the happy red flashing light on the Smoothstepper would not longer flash. 
          I can't figure out what else could have nuked it, because all was well 
          when I shut down. Looks like I should have unplugged the unit entirely 
          for the storm.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have a new Smoothstepper 
          on order. Man, these little electronics failures are not cheap!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being desperate to do some 
          work in the shop, but not having the working mill, I decided to mount 
          the VFD in its NEMA enclosure:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/VFD/P1011038.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'll be wanting 
          to control the spindle via Mach3 soon, and I'll also want to mount my 
          more powerful and faster motor, so this was a good move. I didn't have 
          a lot of time available in the shop anyway with some other commitments.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Blew Up 
          a Geckodrive </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I started out tonight after 
          work to make some more chips. I wanted to square up 2 pieces of 1/4&quot; 
          MIC6 so they'd be 2&quot; x 6&quot; for a <a href="CCComberRotary.htm">steam 
          engine team build</a> I'm participating in. I discovered the Z was faulting 
          off and on so I decided to crank up the tuning on all 3 axes. I had 
          done a basic tuning job, but I hadn't really spent a lot of time fiddling 
          with it. The mill head is very heavy, so I wanted to be sure it was 
          really tuned up well to stop the faulting. I knew I had a tuning problem 
          because it was only faulting when I wanted to raise the head, and then 
          only when I did so rapidly. I turned down the acceleration a bit, and 
          that was happier, but I'd still get a fault every now and then.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, I decided to redo the 
          servos. I got out my screwdriver and started tuning. I was following 
          a &quot;by ear&quot; approach based on <a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/geckodrive/message/16004">several</a> 
          <a href="http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/geckodrive/message/16352">articles</a> 
          <a href="http://support.motioneng.com/Downloads-Notes/Tuning/pid_overshoot.htm">I 
          found</a> on the web. In general, I did the following:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Start with gain and damping 
          turned all the way down.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Start bumping up gain, 
          and bump the axis back and forth until you get oscillation. You'll know 
          when you get it, it can be pretty strong.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Increase the damping until 
          the oscillation goes away and the servo is quiet. An occasional &quot;tick&quot; 
          is supposed to be okay, that's just a bit of dithering, but make sure 
          it is occassional.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This procedure was actually 
          not all that hard, and before long I was ready to start machining again, 
          or so I thought.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I set up a 1/4&quot; 2 flute 
          in an R8 holder, zeroed the X, Y, and Z on my 2 plates in the vise, 
          and fired up the Mach3 surfacing wizard. It came back with some g-code 
          it said would take about 12 minutes so I cut it loose, and sat back 
          to watch. It seemed to be running along fine, but about 10 minutes into 
          it, I got up off my stool and decided to go try to listen closely to 
          each servo motor. I checked the Y, and it was good, but when I got to 
          the X something looked odd. It sounded fine (hard to hear it clearly 
          over the noise of the cutter), but the print on the timing belt looked 
          slightly fuzzy. I decided I was seeing some oscillation and headed back 
          to the controls to shut down. Before I could get there, poof! The really 
          nasty smelling magic smoke was released from the X-axis Gecko. It had 
          been oscillation and it had burnt up the servodrive. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doh!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I shut down, went upstairs, 
          and ordered 2 new Gecko 320's via 2nd day air. I was determined to make 
          some real chips this coming weekend!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Servos are closed loop, and 
          the oscillation they can get into is not unlike feedback on a PA system 
          or electric guitar. Left unchecked, it can cause problems. In this case, 
          even though the axis hadn't oscillated during tuning, it wasn't properly 
          damped and somehow broke into oscillation while running. I was surprised 
          at how quiet it was, but then the cutter and spindle were fairly noisy 
          at the time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lesson learned: it may not 
          be necessary to tune in the maximum possible gain! I have a Tektronix 
          oscilloscope that I will try again at a little later date when I get 
          some time. Meanwhile, I will manually tune a bit less aggressively.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Towards the end of this weekend 
          I got the machine all back together and was able to cut my first chips 
          under CNC control. Exciting stuff! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent quite a lot of time 
          on what appears to be a dead motor. I took it apart and tested the capacitors. 
          Looked like a bad starting cap. So I found another starting cap and 
          tried that. Still nothing but a buzz when I flicked it on. At that point 
          I was too eager to get going, so I just swapped the motor off the manual 
          mill onto the CNC mill. Nice to have that extra mill! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent a little bit of time

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent about 40 minutes 
          in the shop dinking around with the square head bolts I got from McMaster 
          Carr. I ordered 3 3&quot; long 5/8&quot; 11 TPI square head bolts. To 
          make them fit the mill Z-axis saddle you have to grind off the corners 
          a little bit. 3&quot; bolts are also a tad too long. With the bolts 
          in the saddle I measure that I needed to shorten the bolts about 5/8&quot; 
          for a comfortable clearance. That would mean that 2 1/2&quot; bolts 
          might have worked out okay.</font></p>

          outlets for other things). The next logical step is to mount the spindle 
          head, but i'm stuck until I get some parts I ordered from McMaster-Carr. 
          I need the square head bolts needed to secure the spindle to the Z-axis. 
          They got misplaced somehow from the box of parts that came with the 
          mill. I didn't discover this until the work week had begun so naturally

          backlash. If you change directions accidently, you have to start over. 
          I jogged slowly up to the indicator until the needle registered about 
          half a turn, then I zeroed the indicator...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/P1011019.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then I jogged, 
          being careful to move entirely in one direction until the indicator 
          registered zero against the 1-2-3 block I'm using as a back stop. In 
          Mach3 you can job in thousandths or tenths. Try that with your handwheels!</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/P1011020.JPG" width="1024" height="552"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now read the 
          distance off the Mach3 X-axis DRO and compare it to the actual length 
          of your 2-4-6 block. Mine turned out to be 6.0014&quot; long. The X 
          distance travelled was 5.9653&quot; according to the DRO. The difference 
          between the two tells me how much I need to increase my steps per inch 
          with a simple ratio calculation. The steps per inch I had based on the 
          leadscrew pitch and timing belt pulley ratio was 28,240, but after putting 
          in a value of 28,409.9 and trying again it came out exactly right! </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/P1011021.JPG" width="1024" height="785"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here I am 
          tramming in to do the same thing on the Y-axis. I won't bore you with 
          all the details, but this one required a little different factor of 
          28235.8 steps per inch. Note that in theory X and Y should have been 
          identical. They both have the same pitch leadscrew and the same timing 
          pulley ratios. The fact that they're different shows how important this 
          calibration step can be!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next I measured 
          my backlash on both axes. This is easy. Job up to the 1-2-3 block until 
          the indicator ticks. Zero the indicator and the DRO for that axis. Back 
          off an inch and then jog back in until the indicator zeros. Whatever 
          the DRO reads is you backlash. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got 0.0003&quot; 
          for the Y-axis and 0.0006&quot; for the X-axis. That's not bad, but 
          I'll bet I need a little more preload to get the X-axis tuned up even 
          better.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn't bother 
          with the Z-axis since I don't have the heavy spindle head mounted yet. 
          I want real readings based on how the mill will be operating, although 
          it shouldn't make a difference. </font></p>

        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Very messy wiring. 
        After I get everything working, I'll be milling new panels (using this 
        CNC mill of course) and I'll take that opportunity to build some real 
        wiring harnesses that clean this up!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wiring is 
        pretty messy, but I'll be rejiggering it to make some real wiring harnesses 
        and clean it up on a future pass. Right now I just want to make it work. 
        Most of my difficulties have been with the C17 card and getting it to 
        reliably deal with servo faults. I haven't yet decided whether the board 
        is flaky, or whether I'm just using it wrong. I do know I have seen it 
        do some pretty odd things. When I got everything into this cabinet, for 
        example, it completely quit closing the relay during the startup sequence. 
        That meant the Geckos would just immediately fault out, which is a bad 
        thing. If you read my diagnosis page, you'll see I keep having this problem 
        over and over. Each time the fix is a little different. This time I got 
        things going again by connecting the switched side of the Start button 
        to the DC supply relay. That ensures it gets closed during the Start cycle 
        regardless of what the C17 chooses to do. As is usual for me, I didn't 
        think of this solution until after I'd slept overnight from a frustrating 
        earlier session. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I've got all 
        3 servos spinning. X tends to fault out, but that's just because I don't 
        have the servos in a very good state of tune. There's liittle point in 
        it until I can get them mounted on the machine anyway because they'll 
        just need returning. Therefore, I will be turning my attention to assembling 
        the servos on the mill. I plan to mount the timing pulleys onto the servo 
        shafts using 1/8&quot; roll pins. This is how IH does it on their turnkey 
        systems and it'll be a lot more solid than trying to use setscrews on 
        the powerful motors I've got. Towards that end, I was researching the 
        proper hole sizes to drill and came across a page from SDP-SI on it <a href="http://www.sdp-si.com/D790/PDF/D790C10060.pdf">here</a>.</font></p>

        Are Done Pending 2 Cables</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All three axis modules are 
        now assembled and tested. As I was finalizing the last of the three modules, 
        I decided I wanted a quick disconnect on the signal wires, so I made up 
        a cable out of a male and female DB9, and that looks like it will work 
        well. I just need to make 2 more of those cables for use with the other 
        2 axis modules.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is what a finished module 
        looks like with the quick disconnect:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Enclosure/P1010988.jpg" width="1024" height="657"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To install an 
        axis module in the enclosure requires 2 connections--the quick connect 
        is all the signal level stuff, and then there are the main DC power supply 
        + and - that go to bus bars. It should be pretty quick and easy to install 
        one or switch one with another to clear up some issue. I could've skipped 
        the quick connect, but I got to thinking about poking and prodding inside 
        that enclosure on my hands and knees and wanted to make it easier.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's next?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. I need to finish 
        making the other 2 quick connect cables. That'll be easy to do during 
        the week, I hope.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. I need to clean 
        up the enclosure itself, get it mounted on the side of the rolling chest, 
        and get the electronics mounted inside and tested.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Last step is 
        I need to install the servos on the mill and then see the axes move.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="BlogTitle">Major Milestone: 
        Spinning a Servo! (When Debugging, Whatever Can Go Wrong Will Go Wrong)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just now got 1 servo spinning 
        on the bench after 2 1/2 days of trial and error debugging. If you want 
        the full story of how I debugged this silling thing, I captured it <a href="CCMillCNCDebugging.htm">on 
        a page</a> so you can see how I went about it. It's a painful process 
        as not all of the relevant information you will need is captured in one 
        single place. Some of it was out there, but a lot of it I just had to 
        figure out on my own.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a concise list of all 
        the things I had to change from my original attempt to run:</font></p>
      <p> 
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set CNC4PC Master Control 
          Board DIP switches for G320. It acts funny on the other board types 
          whether or not Err/Res is connected.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Discovered I had mislabeled 
          the leads from my front panel for the &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;E-stop&quot;, 
          so they were connected backwards.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reverse the motor connections 
          because they were backwards compared to what the encoder indicated, 
          causing an immediate servo fault.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In doing #3, I reversed 
          the wrong leads and had to replace the power supply rectifier. I don't 
          think I blew the Gecko, amazingly!</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Connect a 47K ohm resistor 
          across pins 1 and 3 of the G320 to ensure the bridge initializes properly. 
          This was buried in a hard to find Mariss note on CNCZone.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I was getting the servo 
          to hold position, so I played with the tuning trimpots a bit.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Mach3, set Step/Dir to 
          ActiveLo. Set pulse width to 5 (the pulse width may be ignored for Smoothstepper).</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Connect &quot;Common&quot; 
          on G320 to +5V on breakout card instead of Ground. Another one that's 
          easy to miss unless you read a lot of posts on various boards!</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set up the proper motor 
          tuning parameters on Mach3. IH says 115 IPM speed and 0.15g of acceleration, 
          according to another post I found. I also needed 28,240 steps to move 
          1&quot;.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set the Smoothstepper jumpers 
          to actually provide +5V to the breakout board. Otherwise, the terminals 
          marked &quot;+5V&quot; are 0V!</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I can spin the servo this 
        way and that with Mach3. It can still fault if I rapidly change directions 
        at full jog, but that's just tuning and I need to set it properly on the 
        actual machine instead of with servos flopping around on the floor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I must admit that per the discussion 
        on the Cookbook Blog on the Eternal Servo vs Stepper Jihad, it was a lot 
        harder to spin a servo than a stepper. In general, I encountered a lot 
        of less than obvious things including the CNC4PC DIP switch settings, 
        need for the 47K ohm resistor (that's going to be built into the next 
        generation Gecko servo drives), and bizarre experiences with &quot;Common&quot;, 
        which has to be +5V, and which didn't get +5V until the Smoothstepper 
        jumpers were enabled.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some photos of my 
        CNC electronics testing lab on the dining room table (my wife is glad 
        it seems to be working and I'm cursing a lot less!):</font></p>

        Out Mach 3 Parameters for My Servos</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have 500 CPR encoders on 
        my servos, which means 500 x 4 = 2000 steps per motor revolution. It takes 
        5 (leadscrew pitch) * 2.824 (timing belt ratio) rotations to move the 
        X or Y axes 1&quot;. So, I need 2000 * 5 * 2.824 = 28,240 steps per inch 
        of axis motion. IH runs at 100 IPM, so I'll set this maximum speed initially.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been busily making cables 
        and wiring up the enclosure. There are a lot of connections here! I have 
        my wiring diagram and I am coloring in each connection as I finish making 
        it. Everything is point to point, so I am making little wiring harnesses 
        and trying to keep it neat.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the moment I'm just trying 
        to get to the point where I can make one axis module active and spin a 
        single servo motor. If that all works, I will assemble and test the other 
        2 axis modules. After that it will be time to finish up the enclosure. 
        I got a neat powder coating kit from my brother for Christmas, and I just 
        ordered some Ocean Blue powder coat from Caswell Plating. I think the 
        Ocean Blue will match the IH mill blue pretty good. Powder coat is very 
        durable. Not really necessary for this application, but I thought it would 
        be fun to try it out!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can be forgiven if you 
        don't think I've been doing anything for 3 weeks. Reallity is I've actually 
        been pretty busy. It takes a ridiculous amount of research to figure out 
        how to wire up one of these CNC projects right, so that's a big part of 
        what I've been doing. Ordering various ancillary parts and mounting my 
        various little sub-circuit boards to a big mounting plate that goes in

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been getting in a plethora 
        of odds and ends to start wiring up the enclosure. I've now got everything 
        except a relay I will use for the E-stop circuit and the master AC on/off 
        switch for the front panel. I also did a number of versions of the overall 
        schematic. The latest is on the <a href="CCMillCNCElectronics.html">enclosure 
        page</a>. Based on my latest schematics, I've done a layout for how I'll 
        go about mounting the various sub-boards in the enclosure:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Enclosure/EnclosureBoards.jpg" width="1024" height="719"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My goal this weekend 
        would be to get the enclosure to the point I can actually mount the boards 
        and begin the wiring process next weekend, and hopefully try spinning 
        some servos (though not on the machine) next weekend as well. There's 
        quite a bit of work to do there, but if I get enough hours I should reach 
        that stage. Fingers crossed!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I still need to 
        make an arm to support the keyboard and monitor, I need to mount the enclosure 
        to the rolling cabinet, and I also need to paint it.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's still 
        a lot of fussing. I haven't spec'd or ordered any of the auxilliary panel 
        connectors, for example. I have some sitting around the parts bin that 
        will hopefully work. Have to look at them as well. If need be, I can delay 
        VFD and coolant wiring until after the servos are running and it would 
        be no big deal.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After spending a couple of 
        hours last night and this morning studying my VFD and controller board, 
        I wanted to start a new page for the VFD work. The work required to control 
        the mill spindle from Mach3 is not terribly hard, but there are a lot

        Progress this Morning</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two hours this morning, and 
        while I did a lot of different things, it doesn't feel like all that much 
        progress. Doh!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I started out with my new treppaning 
        hole cutter from SPI. I've had so much trouble make large holes in metal 
        sheet over the years I finally sprung for a professional tool. I started 
        out trying to finish the meter hole on the 3rd axis module. Things got 
        off to a good start and then got progressively worse until the little 
        tool snapped clean off! Fer cryin' out loud!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am now convinced the evil 
        mystery metal I got from the hardware store is some sort of steel that 
        work hardens very easily. I can find no other explanation for how difficult 
        it is to work with. In any event, before it broke the cutter almost got 
        through, so I knocked the disk out with a ball peen hammer. I need to 
        clean up part of the hole with an abrasive grinder of some sort, but it'll 
        be fine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I turned from that to mounting 
        the Antek power supply in the enclosure box. That was no big deal: set 
        supply in position, mark holes, drill holes, done! So that's ready to 
        go when it's time. I'll leave the supply out of the box for the time being 
        because there is still more cutting and drilling to do there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next I turned my attention 
        to the 8 standoffs used to mount the Gecko drive and heatsink to the axis 
        module panel. These 8 had not yet had holes drilled and tapped in either 
        end. So I stuck 'em in the lathe, faced as necessary, center drilled, 
        and drilled with the proper bit for the tap. When all 8 were done, I went 
        over to the mill and power tapped each hole with a spiral flute tap. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's two hours of my morning 
        and now it's lunch time. Nothing worth taking a picture of even.</font></p>

        location of everything else before I try to position the fan. My current 
        thinking is to put it in the door next to the hinge and up high to exhaust

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you can see 
        I have an issue with meter clearance and the mounting bolts, so I made 
        an oversized hole to try to create some &quot;wiggle room&quot;. This 
        happened due to an error in laying out the big square face during the 
        CAD design. What I need to do is relocate the whole meter 1/4&quot; down 
        the panel and all would be well.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've gotten it 
        close enough, I think. I can't go much further or I'll lose the mounting 
        holes for the meter as you can see in this behind shot. In the end, I'm 
        planning to remake these panels anyway once the CNC is up and running. 
        I'll make them out of 1/4&quot; aluminum plate and put some engraving 
        and other decorative touches on so they'll look a lot nicer.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The servo motors come from 
        Homeshopcnc with just a short tail on them, so you'll need to attach a 
        longer cable back to you electronics cabinet. I decided to use IES-style 
        power cords for mine. These are the same power cables a PC uses. I chose 
        them becaues they're cheap, the servo only has 3 conductors like a power 
        cord, and they're designed to carry current. My one reservation would 
        be that they're not shielded, so the noise from the servos will escape. 
        That means I need to take care the rest of the cables, for example the 
        limit switch and encoder cables, are properly shielded for noise and the 
        shields are grounded.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tonight was a productive evening 
        in the shop!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I discovered some time back 
        that the 72 tooth timing belts I ordered for the X and Y axes were too 
        small. Doh! Turns out I made a minor miscalculation in the geometry involved. 
        I was very concerened I would discover the timing pulleys I had ordered 
        were also not going to work as you can only get belts in certain sizes. 
        Fortunately, luck shined on me and I found that a 75 tooth belt works 
        fine. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, I got a bunch 
        of &quot;legs&quot; turned on the lathe so I could start assembling the

        bunch of IES electrical sockets for the servo power cables, a bunch of 
        3AG fuse holders, and a bunch of female DB-9 connectors, as well as 4 
        15 amp panel ammeters. It's time to start thinking about the sheet metal 
        panels. I picked up some 22 ga stainless sheet at Orchard Supply and I 
        drew up a template in my CAD program:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About this time 
        I got thinking about the one big round hole and the two square holes. 
        Painful to make with my current equipment. I'll have to go buy a hole 
        saw for the big round hole (for my load meter), and the squares have to 
        be made by drilling out the corners as marked on my template and them 
        milling or perhaps nibbling across to connect up the holes. All in all 
        its a bit of a nuisance, and its got me thinking about punch and die work. 
        I'd need 3 punches: one for the meter hole and 1 each for the DB-9 and 
        IES power connector square holes. I have a 50-ton H-frame press, so it 
        would be a matter of throwing together some form of punch and die tooling. 
        Realistically, that's even more work than just making the panels the original 
        way I had planned, but it sure is more interesting work. Gotta think about 
        whether to go there or just git 'er done!</font> </p>

        have a 1/2&quot; bore, they just won't work. There isn't enough meat on 
        them to bore out that much. So, I had to figure out a new plan. After 
        some fooling around to measure the shaft center distance on the bracket 
        (it doesn't adjust, so you had better get it right!), I came up with a

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay, so what's the closest 
        pulley for the motor that will fit my shaft and work with an off-the-shelf 
        timing belt without having to change the shaft to shaft distance or modify 
        the bracket? Turns out SDP-SI has <a href="http://www.sdp-si.com/Cd/default.htm">a 
        nifty little calculator</a> for this purpose. It didn't take too much 
        fooling around before I figured out that a 72 tooth belt (instead of the 
        stock 70 tooth belts) and a 17 tooth motor pulley would do the job. I 
        ordered these from SDP-SI at a total cost of about $40. Not cheap, but 
        the belts were half that and making 2 timing pulleys would consume a lot 
        of time that I could not spend elsewhere.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Note after the fact (10/30/08):</b> 
        The 72 tooth belts don't fit but a 75 tooth works great with this pulley 
        combination. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My reduction ratio on the X 
        and Y axis will now be 48/17 or about 2.824:1 instead of 4:1. The stock 
        IH kit comes with 410 oz/in servos but I'm running 850 oz/in, so I doubt 
        I'll run short of torque. I'm running the 500 resolution encoders, but 
        they're on the motor instead of on the ballscrew like the IH kit. So, 
        IH gears down 4000 cpr encoders (I deduce given their 50 millionths resolution 
        figure, hmmm) by 4:1 getting a resolution of 4000/4 = 1000 counts per 
        motor revolution and 4000 counts per ballscrew resolution. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
        is a thing about this 50 millionths figure from IH: none of the likely 
        encoders from <a href="http://www.usdigital.com/products/encoders/incremental/">US 
        Digital </a>come anywhere near 4000 counts per revolution. 1000 was the 
        highest I could find. How can they get to the 50 millionths figure then? 
        The answer is not so hard, we use quadrature inputs which give us 4x the 
        resolution for the encoder. So, if IH uses an expensive 1000 count per 
        revolution encoder in quadrature mode, they get 4000 counts per revolution.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's assume I run my 500 count 
        encoders in quadrature mode. I'm running the equivalent of 2000 * 2.824 
        = 2824 counts per ballscrew revolution and 2000 counts per motor revolution. 
        So I appear to have about 70% of the resolution of the IH kit. Instead 
        of 50 millionths, I'll be at 0.7 of a tenth. That's still pretty good! 
        And note that this is actual resolution an encoder can see and a servo 
        drive can do something about.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Steppers, by comparison, are 
        commanded to move a step and have to just assume the proper motion occured. 
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For comparison, let's 
        look at the Tormach, which uses stepper motors instead of servos. I'm 
        not claiming one mill is more accurate than the other, I'm just taking 
        a look at how the numbers work out. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tormach claims resolution of 
        a tenth. That is defined as, &quot;The minimum discrete position move 
        is 0.0001&quot;, this is the resolution of motion.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What can this mean if we investigate 
        closely? Given their definition, it means that 0.0001&quot; corresponds 
        to one step on their stepper motor. A typical stepper has 200 steps in 
        a rotation, so that implies the gear train from step to table motion is 
        1.000&quot; / (200 * 0.0001&quot;) = 50:1. That's a very big reduction, 
        in fact it sounds too big. The IH reduction is 4:1 via pulleys and another 
        5:1 via the ballscrew, or 20:1</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tormach says their rapids speed 
        is 65 ipm. Let's plug these numbers backwards and see what we get:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">65 inches / 0.0001&quot; = 
        650,000 ten thousandths = 650,000 steps per minute</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">650,000 steps per minute / 
        200 steps per revolution = 3250 rpm </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe they can rapid the machine 
        while running the stepper motors at 3250 rpm, but that seems really fast 
        for a stepper motor. Most of them in this kind of size range have a torque 
        peak much lower than that. <a href="http://www.tormach.com/document_library/TD30204_DesignAnalysis.pdf">Tormach's 
        Design Analysis</a> talks about torque falling off rapidly in just a few 
        hundred rpm. My assumption would be that the 0.0001&quot; resolution is 
        not realizable in practice and is based on something such as microstepping 
        (the Tordrive has 10x microstepping, for example which would mean divide 
        everything by 10 if we're talking microsteps). If I am right about the 
        microstepping, the real resolution is more like 0.001&quot;, which is 
        fine, and completely in keeping with the mill's stated performance. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why doesn't microstepping count? 
        Because you can't maintain full torque on a microstep unless it corresponds 
        to a full step. They're largely about smoother acceleration and motion 
        more than they are about accuracy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I like the Tormach mill, BTW, 
        I was just curious to work through the figures and see what I could learn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Update on Tormach</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I confirmed a few things from 
        <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?p=509974#post509974">some 
        Tormach owners on CNCZone</a>. The Tormach direct drives the ballscrews 
        with no reduction, and the lead on the ballscrews is the same as IH: 5 
        turns to the inch. So, at full rapids, the Tormach is doing 325 rpm as 
        suspected. And also as suspected, you have to assume 10x microstepping 
        to get to the 50 millionths resolution. My understanding was that you 
        shouldn't count on microsteps for increased resolution because the torque 
        was very low. That turns out to have been wrong. There is <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13678">a 
        great series of posts by Mariss F.</a> on CNCZone that lay it all out. 
        The long and the short of it is that you can take advantage of up to 10x 
        microstepping and still have about 70% of the torque and full positional 
        accuracy. Therefore Tormachs 50 millionths resolution claim is quite defensible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now of course there are other 
        issues that prevent the machine from being that accurate in general, but 
        Tormach only claims about 0.001&quot; precision, which is very plausible 
        provided you run the system in a way that loses no steps. A servo system 
        still have the potential to be more accurate because it can get back on 
        track after the fact. Whether that's acceptible or not to your application 
        is a whole other question I won't delve into here.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was gratifying to see that 
        my math all worked out properly with the real data on the Tormach that 
        I didn't have access to!</font></p>

        the column without a ladder unless your machine is on the floor. So I 
        mounted everything temporarily and then disassembled it. As soon as I

        the column up. The holes for the mounting the ballscrew and servo are 
        all drilled and tapped, so it should be fast. After that, I need to:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Plumb the Z-axis

        build. I was able to carve out a little time over this Fourth of July 
        three day weekend to make slight progress. I've basically epoxied a base 
        plate into the bottom of the column along with a pipe that provides a 
        bore for the big column bolt to go through:</font></p>
      <p  align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010790.JPG" width="1024" height="709"></font></p>
      <p  align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The surface tension 
        works nicely to let me apply a fair amount of epoxy. I just want enough 
        to hold the pipe solidly so that when I flip the column over start adding 
        the E/G mixture from above it won't break loose. I'll let this cure all 
        week and then hopefully tackle the column fill next weekend. I've decided 
        not to fill the column all the way up. This arrangement will fill the 
        bottom 10&quot; or so and should add considerable dampening without in 
        any way being a clearance problem. I would think this will really help 
        the mill to perform better to have this much added dampening mass in the 
        critical junction between the base and the column. More would be better, 
        but I'm anxious to get on with the rest of the CNC conversion and there 
        is a lot of work to do!</font></p>

        Set of Servos and Gecko Drives from HomeShopCNC</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After reading 
        a note sent to me by <a href="http://www.ptengineeringllc.com/">Peter 
        Tsukamoto</a>, I got inspired to take a step of some kind on the mill 
        to move this conversion forward. Peter started with a Unimat lathe 30 
        years ago and today he owns a full machine shop in Hawaii. Guys like that 
        are always an inspiration to me, so I try to listen carefully when they 
        have some advice for me. In Peter's words:</font></p>
      <p align="left"> 
      <blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>See if you can 
        get your CNC mill going as a priority. It will open up new vistas in a 
        way you cannot believe. It will accelerate any project you work on. Make 
        them way more enjoyable too. </b></font></blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He makes a lot 
        of sense there. Every time I perform a manual machining operation on my 
        lathe or mill I think about what the CNC equivalent would be. In almost 
        every case I could do the job much faster, more easily, and often better 
        with CNC. There's a reason it took the industry by storm years ago!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple things 
        have been holding up my progress. First, I've been spending a ton of time 
        lately on a <a href="CCRevOpenCol.htm">Steam Engine Team Build</a> that 
        has involved creating some tooling and a number of other things. The other 
        problem that was distressing me was that I had misplaced the <a href="http://www.industrialhobbies.com/">Industrial 
        Hobbies CNC conversion kit</a> somewhere in my house. I'd been looking 
        for it off and on for days, and the number of places it could be was dwindling. 
        After spending 45 minutes in the garage shifting things around and checking 
        every last possible hiding place underneath all the junk, real panic set 
        in. Paraphrasing Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, when you've eliminated 
        all the possibles, you have to start considering the impossibles. Eventually 
        I discovered that my kids had pressed the two boxes into service to create 
        a stand for their Karaoke machine. They were hidden underneath a black 
        table cloth to make it even harder. I heaved a mighty sigh of relief after 
        making that discovery!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, having located 
        the components, I decided to take another step and ordered up a set of 
        servos and drives from <a href="http://www.homeshopcnc.com/page3.html">HomeShopCNC</a>. 
        I also looked at <a href="http://www.kelinginc.net/">Keling</a> as another 
        source. HomeShopCNC was just slightly cheaper on Gecko drives, and I liked 
        the nifty anodized housings for the encoders:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Servos/ServoMotor.jpg" width="792" height="537"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I like the nifty 
        anodized housing for the encoder...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are 850 
        oz in servos, and Keling had a bigger model at a whopping 1125 oz in. 
        Why not just buy the bigger-is-better plan? Well, because there are trade 
        offs. It's worth noting that the standard IH CNC kit comes with 410 oz 
        in on the X/Y axes and 648 on the Z--that mill head is heavy! Their heavy 
        duty kit looks to me like is substitutes the bigger Z servo on the X/Y 
        axes. Either way, I should be fine with 850 oz in. Now here is the rub. 
        The big Kelling 1125 oz in servo peaks out at 3200 rpm whereas the 850's 
        I got are spec'd for 4200 rpm. I don't know if I'll ever get to use the 
        extra rpm to increase my rapids or not, but bigger servos are often slower 
        and the same is true of stepper motors. I think these 850's will be a 
        decent compromise and they'll give me some room to experiment on my feeds 
        and speeds. If the Z gives me any trouble I figure I can build a counterweighting 
        system with some gas springs and radically reduce the force needed there 
        too.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While I'm talking 
        about alternatives, I should mention that I did some serious looking around 
        for an alternative to the Gecko drives. Why? Customer Service. That's 
        got to come as a surprise because Gecko has some of the best customer 
        service reputation in the industry. The trouble is, I ran afoul of one 
        of the counter examples of that. My GRex for my <a href="CCLatheCNCHome.htm">CNC 
        lathe project</a> has been a disaster. The good news: it was very easy 
        to get it working, and I like the idea of not relying on the parallel 
        port. In theory, it could save me a lot of trouble, especially since I 
        had envisioned a fancy control panel for it. The reality? The device has 
        never lived up to its original promises. It has had teething troubles 
        since the beginning, and most of it has never gotten fixed. There are 
        problems with 3D profiling on the mill that make it a questionable solution 
        there, and the device doesn't support spindle indexing on the lathe, which 
        is a requirement for threading. What good is a lathe that can't thread? 
        Many promises were made over time about this being fixed, and we're talking 
        a span of years. Unfortunately, it has never panned out. Gecko blames 
        it on the firmware and says it isn't their fault. I think that's silly, 
        and it certainly was not the story at the outset. I sent Mariss a note 
        offering to trade my perfectly good GRex for a set of 3 of his cheapest 
        servo drives (which combined were less than the GRex cost), and explained 
        my problem with the GRex. I never even got a response back from Gecko. 
        That's just not good customer service in my book, despite their stellar 
        reputation.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So how did I wind 
        up buying another set of Gecko drives anyway? Here's the rub--who else 
        is there? Rutex is in an odd state. The parent is Australian, and the 
        designer has gone missing there last I heard. Reports vary on whether 
        the boards can be gotten here though the US distributor says yes. Last 
        thing I want to deal with is another strange situation with one of these 
        boards though the Rutex has a lot of advantages over the Geckos on paper, 
        and there are certainly those who swear by them. I also looked at the 
        <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=14217&amp;highlight=uhu+servo+drive+kit">UHU 
        family of servo drives</a>. These look to be excellent, but so far they 
        are either awfully expensive if you buy one already built, or you deal 
        with cobbling together a kit. Frankly, I was tempted to go the kit route 
        anyway, just to avoid Gecko. I enjoy building electronics and I'm pretty 
        good at it. The trouble is, Peter's words kept nagging at me. How much 
        would it set back my conversion to have to build and debug 3 servo controller 
        boards? So I got the Geckos. They were cheap when bought with the servos 
        anyway. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, it wouldn't 
        have taken much to get me to buy something from someone else. I guess 
        that's the power of customer service. Given his reputation, I can't understand 
        why Mariss wouldn't do something for me. Oh well, I sure hope these new 
        drivers are flawless or I will build the UHU boards.</font></p>

        my <a href="CCMillCNCToDo.html">To Do list for the mill </a>to a finer

        progress I can make on the mill conversion.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's what we 
        got the next morning:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010301.JPG" width="512" height="605"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/EpoxyGraniteFill/P1010302.JPG" width="512" height="605"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Test was successful!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The test was successful. 
        The aggregate is embeded in the epoxy. The slug took a very accurate impression 
        from the cup--you can even see scratches made in the plastic by the gravel's 
        sharp edges are faitfully reproduced. I suspect creating a precision surface 
        in this material is easy if you have a precision mold. The material released 
        easily from the plastic cup--just a couple sharp raps on workbench and 
        it dropped right out. The ugly parts are at the air-epoxy interface from 
        the top of cup. There are various approaches to eliminating the air bubbles, 
        but it doesn't seem like there were many bubbles trapped in the material 
        from the mixing process--they're all at the top. A quick pass with a heat 
        gun is rumored to be the quick trick to get rid of those.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point, 
        I can't see much point in monkeying with success. It may be that a 10% 
        epoxy formula would be better, but this will work just fine for this project. 
        I plan to keep Epoxy Granite in mind for other projects. I understand 
        it sets up with an accuracy of 0.001&quot; on top if you get rid of bubbles, 
        so you could make a surface plate from it.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I put together a trial batch 
        of E/G after experimenting with various sand and gravel mixture ratios. 
        It's a mud pie:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mixture I arrived at wound 
        up using these proportions by weight with epoxy resin:</font></p>

      <blockquote>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23% sand</font></p>

      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That worked out pretty darned 
        well if I do say so myself as I was shooting for a little under 15% epoxy 
        resin by weight. In terms of volumes, this was 1/8+1/4+1/3 cup of gravel, 
        1/4 cup of sand, and 1 1/2 pumps each of resin and hardener. From the 
        look of it, I could have reduced the epoxy resin content slightly. At 
        one point it seemed to dry, but as I kept stirring and getting all the 
        aggregate coated it turned liquid again and life was good. We'll see how 
        it turns out tomorrow after it has cured overnight. If the test is successful, 
        this is going to be a remarkably easy thing to do!</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I completed the lapping of 
        all ways yesterday. The hardest part is wrestling the heavy components 
        around. I did the Y-Axis by myself, but talked my brother into being on 
        hand for the table and column. As we finished each axis, I thoroughly 
        cleaned the axis with kerosene, applied generous way lube, adjusted the 
        gibs until as tight as I could get smooth motion by hand and then checked 
        out the feel of the axis. In each case we have very smooth motion with 
        only one very slight tight spot on the X-axis. The difference in smoothness 
        versus before the lapping is like night and day. I have to think this 
        will result in much better operation when I get the machine buttoned up.</font></p>

        it until a paper towel picks up no more residue so as not to contaminate 
        later grits with old coarse grit...</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A little closer 
        look at the paste. Note we're not getting right up against the dovetail 
        too well. That's beacuse this is still the 220 and I've only started to 
        put the gib in at this point. That was again per IH instructions...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/MillStuff/CNC/Lapping/P1010259.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here is 
        where we got to after the final grit. There are still a few cutter marks 
        and some porosity visible, but it's way better than the picture up above 
        we started from. That's what we're looking for!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, as IH says, 
        we aren't going to try to eliminate every last tool mark. To do so is 
        to invite going too far and possibly compromising the trueness of the 
        way. This is an adequate compromise. What I think will really help is 
        tying these new smoother ways with my one shot oiler, which will ensure 
        much more consistent lubing than I've had in the past. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing you 
        notice is that the ways get progressively smoother as you go through the 
        grits. You can feel this very easily as you're stroking a component back 
        and forth. It is particularly obvious when you insert the gib, run for 
        a bit at 220 grit with the gib loose, and then are finally able to tighten 
        the gib and still get smooth motion. I doubt very much I could've moved 
        the saddle with the gib in and tightened and nothing but kerosene as a 
        lubricant before I started this process!</font></p>
      <p class="BlogDate">2/17/08</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process of conversion began 
        today. My second IH mill has been sitting on the shelf for a little over 
        one year, and I decided to finally get going on the conversion work. Fortunately, 
        the mill was disassembled before being put away for storage. Equally fortunately, 
        I applied a treatment of Break-Free rust inhibitor to all the bare metal 
        surfaces, so there was no rust to speak of visible anywhere.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Why Lap and is it Dangerous 
        for Machine Accuracy?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step in the process 
        is lapping the ways. I'm starting here because my next stops will be installing 
        a one shot oiling system and filling some of the castings with epoxy granite 
        to help dampen and stiffen them. I don't want the one shot oil passages 
        to get grit in them, so I need to finish lapping before I begin that task.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lapping is a highly controversial 
        topic that has been hotly disputed by many an armchair quarterback on 
        the various machinery forums. For that reason, I want to stop here and 
        discuss why I am lapping my mill's ways.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First and foremost, I am doing 
        it because after considered discussion with Aaron Moss (the original owner 
        of Industrial Hobbies and likely the world's foremost expert on these 
        mills) I am following his advice. Aaron has lapped many a Chinese mill 
        and swears it is always an improvement. The reasons are twofold. There 
        is a reduction in friction of the ways which helps to reduce stick slip 
        and makes the motions smoother. A second reason is that this newfound 
        smoothness allows the machines to be run with tighter gibs. The upshot 
        is a more accurate and tighter machine. Whatever we may sacrifice in the 
        ultimate trueness of the ways is more than made up for by smoother motion 
        and tighter gibs. I trust Aaron totally on this, and he has the experience 
        to back it up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second reason is that I 
        looked into just how much damage lapping might do to the ways just so 
        I could sleep better at night. The difficulty that this discussion always 
        raises is that lapping will by its nature reduce the accuracy of the ways, 
        making them rounded rather than true.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did some Internet research 
        in an effort to quantify how much material the lapping process may be 
        removing, and thereby how much inaccuracy might be induced by the process. 
        <a href="http://www.surfacefinishes.com/lapping.html">One source</a> indicates 
        that a typical lapping procedure will remove 0.0002" - 0.0005" of material. 
        <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3685/is_199901/ai_n8852420">Another 
        article</a> found that the mean rate of material removal using diamond 
        cutting compound (much more aggressive than the simple aluminum oxide 
        that Aaron Moss recommends for lapping ways) was 0.0004 mm/minute = 0.000029"/minute. 
        Note that these two references involved use of lapping machines and near 
        optimal conditions for maximum material removal. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's briefly consider the 
        schedule lapping suggested by Industrial Hobbies: </font></p>
      <table width="12%" border="1">
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <div align="center"><b>Grit</b></div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center"><b>Strokes</b></div>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>80</td>
          <td>20 - 30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>120</td>
          <td>40 - 50 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>220</td>
          <td>40 - 50 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>320</td>
          <td>40 - 50 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>500</td>
          <td>40 - 50 </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In comparing this schedule 
        to the published material removal rates, let's assume lapping can proceed 
        at the equivalent of 1 stroke per 2 seconds. In essence, we are then talking 
        about 230 strokes being the equivalent of less than 10 minutes of lapping 
        on a machine. Since the grits are made progressively finer, it is probably 
        more equivalent to half that on average, but even if we went at it for 
        a full 1 hour the material removed would be 0.0017" in the absolute worst 
        case. At 10 minutes, we're looking at about 3 tenths. My suspicion is 
        that it is more likely way less than half or even a quarter as much since 
        this approach to lapping is not going to produce optimal material removal 
        rates. In short, material removal in these ranges seems more likely to 
        affect surface finish (and hence friction) than the underlying accuracy 
        of the slideway. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, there is an engineering 
        term for the use of lapping to improve the fit between two components-it's 
        called equalizing lapping. To further cement the case that this is what 
        we're doing when lapping the ways, one uses a hard lap to avoid embedding 
        of the grits in this type of work. Lapping to change the shape of something 
        is called form lapping. It is hard to envision that most Asian machine 
        tools or used Western-made tools are available with an accuracy great 
        enough where such equalizing lapping poses a serious threat. For more 
        information on lapping, consult the <a href="http://www.industrialhobbies.com/">Industrial 
        Hobbies web site</a>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And by all means, follow your 
        own conscience on the matter of whether to lap your ways or leave them 
        alone on an RF-45 mill. Importantly, the latest model IH mills have the 
        ways more carefully ground, so there is no longer a need for lapping on 
        these mills.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Process</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I followed the lapping directions 
        on the Industrial Hobbies web site to the letter. Tonight I began with 
        the Y-axis. I was able to go through the first two grits, 80 and 120, 
        in about 1 hour. This included initial setup, dragging the mill parts 
        out of storage, setting them up on a table, and the actual lapping itself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The work itself is extremely 
        simple. I irrigate the ways with kerosene to act as a lubricant. Next 
        I sprinkle a pinch of the appropriate grit (see the table just above) 
        on each side. Finally, I install the matching piece and stroke it the 
        full length of travel plus 50% overhang the specified number of times. 
        I try to do this smoothly and steadily while keeping the ways in contact 
        on the side without the gib. Initially, we're told to go without the gib 
        and to lap it separately. When I get to 220 grit, it will be time to install 
        the gibs and go from there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the conclusion of these 
        two grits, the ways were noticeably smoother. They'd had some ridges not 
        unlike a file when I began and these were all but gone after the first 
        two grits. So far so good! </font></p>

        as it's about 9:30.</font></p>
