        work on this blog and hopefully get down to the shop.</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Mill Enclosures </p>
      <p class="style1">If you want to run flood coolant, you'll need an enclosure 
        around your mill or the coolant will go everywhere. Here are a few example 
        enclosures that might spark some ideas:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/TreeSplashGuard.jpg" width="531" height="604"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The splash guard on this Tree CNC mill would 
        be a lot easier to build than a full enclosure. It will limit the size 
        of work that can be done, however. The <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37739">Widgitmaster 
        has built a very similar enclosure</a> for his Bridgeport clone:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Widgit/TTopEnclosure.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>The Widgitmaster Enclosure being 
        bolted down to mill table. Note the shiny plate is some work he will dial 
        in. It is located against two pins at the rear.</strong></p>

      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Here's the enclosure in use...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It seems like it would be straightforward 
        to make one of these and to leave room for a vise as well. It's an ideal 
        setup to key in your vice so it will be properly indicated in when you 
        drop it on. It's basically a fixture plate with plexiglass walls.</p>

      <p align="center" class="style6">Here's a more traditional enclosure. I 
        love the way the whole front hinges downward for access. Notice how the 
        coolant is channeled into the drip pan at the bottom...</p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">You can see from the pictures why I like 
        the 80/20 route: it goes together with a minimum of fabrication and comes 
        out looking extremely professional. The extrusions aren't cheap, but I 
        really think they're a very attractive way to go.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Speaking of attractive, here is a <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24496&page=2">totally

        under your desk that are associated with your computer. There are routers, 
        DSL modems, power strips, and every manner of wall wart power supply. 
        It's scary to even go under there and try to plug a new one in or fix

      <p class="style1">I couldn't pass this one up because it seems so cheap 
        and easy to try:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="style1">Take four pieces of 1in pipe weld them to a flat piece 
          of steel. Make it so a five gallon plastic bucket will slide up and 
          down loosely between the pipes. Then pick up a cheap jitterbug sander 
          from harbor Freight. I got one for $9.99 on sale. put a long piece of 
          threaded rod up through the center of bucket to bolt the top down then 
          epoxy a block of plywood to the bottom of the bucket drill out hole 
          to fit over rod and nut on bottom of bucket. bolt the sander to the 
          block of plywood. You put your parts in the bucket with some crushed 
          walnut hulls You can get 13lbs of them on ebay. for 8 bucks. add a little 
          polishing compound to the media. You attach a air hose to the Jitterbug 
          sander. when you set the whole thing bucket and sander down between 
          the rails of pipe it hits the trigger lever which is on top of the sander. 
          it points down when bolted to the bucket. as long as air goes to it 
          the whole bucket will dance It took me 15mins to build this and guess 
          what it works.</p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Mach 3 Controller Limitations </p>
      <p class="style1">I recently came across an interesting thread on the Mach 
        3 boards talking about the limitations of the various controllers. As 
        you may know, there is a relatively new crop of controllers that Mach 
        3 supports that do the step pulsing in the controller, relieving Mach 
        3 of the task. Supported controllers include the Gecko GRex, Galil, and 
        the NCPod. In theory, these boards allow much higher performance because 
        they can deliver a smoother pulse train to the step or servo drivers and 
        many more pulses per second. But here is the rub--each outboard controller 
        has a limitation on the number of moves per second it can accept, and 
        all of them accept a lot fewer moves than a parallel port:</p>
      <p class="style1">Parallel Port: circa 10,000 moves/sec </p>
      <p class="style1">NCPod: 1,000 moves/sec</p>
      <p class="style1">Galil: 250 moves/sec</p>
      <p class="style1">GRex: 50-100 moves/sec</p>
      <p class="style1">Those are some big differences! Does this mean the outboard 
        controllers are all doomed to poor performance relative to the parallel 
        port? Not necessarily, things are more complex than that. Think of the 
        moves as being a rough estimate of the maximum rate g-code moves can be 
        evaluated. If the g-code is making 0.0001&quot; moves to simulate some 
        sort of smooth 3D curve, you get the following maximum rates:</p>
      <p class="style1">Parallel Port: circa 10,000 moves/sec = 1&quot;/sec of 
        0.0001&quot; moves = 60 IPM or 1&quot; of 0.0001&quot; moves</p>
      <p class="style1">NCPod: 1,000 moves/sec = 0.1&quot;/sec of 0.0001&quot; 
        moves = 6 IPM or 0.1&quot; of 0.0001&quot; moves </p>
      <p class="style1">Galil: 250 moves/sec = 0.025&quot;/sec of 0.0001&quot; 
        moves = 1.5 IPM or 0.025&quot; of 0.0001&quot; moves </p>
      <p class="style1">GRex: 50-100 moves/sec = 0.005 - 0.010&quot;/sec = 0.3 
        - 0.6 IPM or 0.005 to 0.010&quot; of 0.0001&quot; moves </p>
      <p class="style1">Wow! Those get to be pretty darned slowed speeds at some 
        point. In fact, these are theoreticals, and there are mitigating circumstances 
        of various kinds. For example, the GRex is far more likely to hit its 
        theoretical maximums than the other boards because it has an internal 
        move planner that looks ahead and smooths acceleration. The others have 
        to deal with start/stop jerking, and so won't hit their theoretical maximum. 
        The parallel port's maximum is mitigated by the ability to generate the 
        necessary pulses to move at those speeds, and as Art will tell you, 60 
        IPM is in the grey zone. Some stepper motors can be tuned up to perform 
        that fast, but many cannot. I know the motors on my <a href="CCCNCMiniRouter.html">CNC 
        MiniRouter</a> cannot--30 IPM is about the best I can do there. </p>
      <p class="style1">So what's to be done about this? It rears its ugly head 
        most often for 3D profiling operations on a mill. What are the chances 
        you need to profile to 0.0001&quot;? What are the chances your mill is 
        accurate enough that its even possible? You probably don't and can't, 
        but the bad news is your CAM program may be throwing out such moves regardless. 
        I took a look at OneCNC XR2 Mill Advantage, the program I use, and there 
        is a parameter for the tolerance on the 3D profiling. I tried creating 
        a program to profile the <a href="CCGunStock.html">rifle stock I designed</a>, 
        which is a demanding 3D task. I set the parameter to 0.0005&quot; tolerance, 
        and posted. The result is a 17,000 line g-code program that OneCNC says 
        would take 3 1/2 hours to run. Incidentally, for wood it wants a feedrate 
        of 4 IPM, which is faster than really small g-code segments can go according 
        to the calculations above, although GRex should be able to hit about 1.5 
        to 3 IPM with 0.0005&quot; segments. I loaded the g-code into Excel and 
        wrote a quick sheet to determine how many moves were less than 0.0005&quot;. 
        Out of the 17,000 odd lines, only 75 made moves less than 0.0005&quot;. 
        The total distance moved in this way was 0.023&quot;. </p>
      <p class="style1">Another way to look at this is to look at how much travel 
        can be had with these short segments before the controller starts to get 
        behind. The parallel port cna go 1&quot;, NCPod 0.1&quot;, Galil 0.025&quot;, 
        and GRex 0.005 to 0.010&quot;. With the worst case being the GRex, we 
        assume that moves of less than 0.005&quot; can eventually lead to falling 
        behing. Since the buffer is 50 to 100 moves/sec, let's assume 50 moves 
        for GRex, 250 moves for Galil, and 1000 moves for NCPod. On my rifle stock 
        sample, the maximum number of moves that are 0.005&quot; or less is 29. 
        It seems to me that the GRex could tolerate up to 50 such moves before 
        it fell behind, so I should be okay. </p>
      <p class="style1">What's my conclusion? I'm not going to worry about this 
        particular buggaboo. The rifle stock model I tested is very curvy, yet 
        OneCNC generated very few g-code moves short enough to cause problems 
        with the GRex. Your mileage may vary! </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">CNC'ing the &quot;Hula Hula&quot; Steam Engine </p>
      <p class="style1">I've been working through the <a href="CCHulaHula.html">drawings 
        for the Hula Hula engine</a> (a Philip Duclos design) and converting them 
        over so I can build the engine using CNC techniques. So far I am just 
        at the Rhino drawing stage, but I'm hoping this can be one of my first 
        projects after completing the conversions on my lathe and mill. Here is 
        a sample drawing:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/SteamEngines/HulaHula/Backplates1.jpg" width="800" height="537"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">As you can see, I have slightly redesigned 
        the parts. Some things that were more easy on the manual mill Duclos used 
        can be better done a different way with CNC. These cylinder backplates 
        and associated holes are a prime example. Duclos originally had these 
        pieces with nothing but square cuts and pointed tops. The point on the 
        top would locate the backplate on the Engine Body, and all holes were 
        to be drilled using the backplates as a guide for greater accuracy and 
        match up. With CNC, it's easier to profile the round shapes shown, and 
        the holes can be drilled with enough precision under CNC control that 
        it isn't necessary to match up the pieces. </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Making Square Holes With Round Pegs </p>
      <p class="style1">I've mentioned in the past that I like to allocate a certain 
        amount of shop time to experimentation. I find that if I do all my learning 
        on projects, I get too fixated on finishing the project, and may shortcut 
        the learning process. When experimenting, everything is scrap, and the 
        only outcome is knowledge. A little of both practical projects and experimentation 
        goes a long way towards making the whole greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
      <p class="style1">Today, I decided to try to make a square hole in a piece 
        of steel. A friend was asking if I knew where to get sockets with square 
        holes for some unusual bolts he had. I suggested a couple of possibilities, 
        but then stepped up and said, &quot;We can make one too out of a donor 
        socket and some scrap metal.&quot; I decided I'd better get going with 
        an experiment before he shows up locking for his socket.</p>
      <p class="style1">My plan was to do the old trick where you cut a square 
        slot, and then &quot;glue&quot; two of those together to make a square 
        hole. In this case, I took a 3/8&quot; end mill, slotted the end of a 
        piece I had squared earlier, sawed then end off, cut that part in two, 
        and then Tig welded the result together. After grinding down the welds, 
        I found the technique to be eminently workable:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MillStuff/P5063955.JPG" width="400" height="379"> 
        <img src="img/MillStuff/P5063956.JPG" width="400" height="360"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Square Hole: Mission Accomplished!</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">A couple of things I learned or that should 
        be noted:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- The left and right sides are not exactly 
        square--they seem to curve to the left. This is because I cut the slot 
        in a single pass the width of the cutter. You want to use a cutter narrower 
        than the slot so that each side gets a nice pass all to itself without 
        cutting forces deflecting things and curving the walls. This is no biggie, 
        I knew that even as I was making the cuts. This was just a test, but I 
        want you to be sure you understand.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Z depth control is critical to squareness. 
        I have some techniques I've written about to get me within 0.001&quot; 
        in the past. Make sure you can do the same if you want your hole to come 
        out square.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- I started with a block I had squared. Good 
        idea!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- I needed to make a few practice passes 
        with the Tig, but instead I just dove in, so the bead is pretty nasty. 
        However, I ground off the bubbles and it is okay. I wouldn't want to run 
        a 5HP motor shaft with it, but it will work to turn square headed bolts! 
        Next time I'll lay a couple beads on some scrap before diving in.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- I tried a slitting saw to cut the slotted 
        piece in two. This was my first time. They work great! I looked up some 
        feeds and speeds and found they want to go real slow. In fact, I found 
        the feed speed was too slow for power feeding, so I just fed manually. 
        As long as you take it easy, I found they cut extremely well and leave 
        a very clean accurate slot behind. I'll be trying one of these again sometime 
        soon!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">So all in all, it was a pretty happy 1 hour 
        segment in the shop to learn a couple of things. I'll hand my pal the 
        test piece and see whether he wants to go ahead making up a custom &quot;square 
        head&quot; socket. </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Obsessed With Precision? (Moore Angle Plate) </p>
      <p class="style1">I guess you could say I'm obsessed with precision. At 
        least I'm obsessed with having the ability to measure and align precisely. 
        A lot of the shortcomings of cheap machine tools can be at least partially 
        overcome if you can measure precisely. For example, adding a precision 
        DRO to a tool can greatly increase the precision of the work you can do 
        on the machine. </p>
      <p class="style1">The science of measurement is called Metrology, and its 
        a complicated business. I keep my eye open for items on eBay that give 
        me a chance to substantially improve my chances for precision. One such 
        that came along recently was this Moore Angle Plate:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/Tooling/MooreAngle1.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The picture doesn't do it justice, because 
        this thing is 36&quot; long and its two surfaces are hand scraped:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/Tooling/MooreAngle2.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Hand scraped precision surface... 
        </strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The name &quot;Moore&quot; is synonymous 
        with ultraprecision in the machine tool world, so I reckon getting my 
        hands on this piece for $140 shipped was a real bargain! I now have a 
        very precise standard that I can use a a straightedge or for checking 
        90 degree angles. If I wanted to make a set of box ways, I could use this 
        angle plate as a standard for scraping them in. The reality is it will 
        probably sit in its box and see only occassional use, but that's okay. 
        I feel like I've significantly extended my shop's capacity for precision. 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I've made a couple of other recent eBay purchases 
        in the precision department. First up is a pair of Browne &amp; Sharp 
        ground parallels. Doesn't sound to impressive? Well, these parallels are 
        1&quot; x 2&quot; x 12&quot;, so they're really BIG! These are ground 
        to 0.0002&quot;. I figure they may be handy for a precision setup of some 
        kind some day. For example, to spread the clamping force if I am milling 
        a big plate I could put these on the edges atop the plate and clamp on 
        them. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I've also got a cylindrical square on the 
        way that looks pretty nice. They're just the thing for checking spindles 
        on mills and that sort of thing. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Lastly, I've been on the lookout for Dial 
        Indicators. I mean the plunger style, not swinging indicators, which are 
        called Dial Test Indicators. I've made do for quite some time with a really 
        cheezy Central Tool indicator, and I wanted something nicer with decent 
        travel. I scored a brand new Starrett with a snazzy 2&quot; dial for about 
        $20 on eBay. The difference in the feel of the action between the Starrett 
        and my cheap indicator are like night and day. The Starret is silky smooth! 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Having some extra indicators will let me 
        keep them set up in their fixtures for faster use. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">A Shopmade Follow Rest and Box Cutters </p>
      <p class="style1">Turning a small diameter piece that's long and skinny 
        is difficult. The piece is going to want to bend and flex and generally 
        make it difficult. Imagine trying to work this piece, for example:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/Tools/ShopmadeBBFollower4.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>That long skinny piece would give 
        me fits! </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">Steady rests and follower rests were made to pick up where 
        the support a tailstock can lend is not enough. Most lathes come with 
        these gadgets, and most folks don't use them often enough--I know I certainly 
        don't. Part of my problem is I have the usual cheap Asian brass tipped 
        units, and I just can't feature that brass riding very happily along the 
        workpiece. It has been in the back of my mind to add some ball bearings. 
        I've got a ton of cheap skate bearings floating around the shop that should 
        be perfect for the job.</p>
      <p class="style1"><a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/30/4459/2.html?">The

      <p align="left" class="style1">The only thing I don't neccessarily like 
        about the QCTP mounted versions is your tool has to be square onto the 
        workpiece. For some operations, that isn't the case, so I think mounting 
        one to the carriage as in the first example might be a little more versatile.

      <p class="BlogTitle">Sine Jaws for the Kurt Vise </p>
      <p class="style1">After cogitating on the idea of putting dowel pins in 
        vise jaws (of which more below on how a fellow did that for another purpose), 
        I did a Rhino drawing to figure out the placement of pins needed to provide 
        a set of angle stops in 5 degree increments from 5 to 45 degrees:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CADDrawings/ViseSineJaws.jpg" width="800" height="586"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">This would be a dead simple thing to do with 
        CNC, but I went ahead and listed DRO coordinates for those who want to 
        play with it on a manual mill. A rotary table would let you do the work 
        very easily as well. The idea is to drill and ream holes for 1/8&quot; 
        precision dowel pins. As you can see these holes are divided between a 
        2&quot; and a 2.5&quot; radius so they don't land too close together. 
        One could either make a little bar with two pins to use as a stop to align 
        the workpiece at the desired angle, or just use two dowel pins in the 
        appropriate holes. I would bore the opposing jaw with holes slightly oversized

      <p class="BlogTitle">QCTP Indicator Holders </p>
      <p class="style1">Someday in the not too distant future I plan to give my 
        lathe a tune up. I want to check spindle runout, adjust the preload on 
        the spindle bearings, check the headstock and tailstock alignments, and 
        generally give it a little TLC. I want it running as accurately as possible 
        before I tackle making the end blocks to hold the ballscrews when I <a href="CCLatheCNCGangSlide.html">convert 
        the lathe over to ballscrews</a>. Angular contact bearings need some pretty 
        close tolerances for installation. I'll also be turning the ends of the 
        ballscrews, so it pays to have it all shipshape.</p>
      <p class="style1">One of the things that I've been seeing for a long time

      <p class="BlogTitle">Super Precision Machine Accuracy Checking: Ballbars 
        and Circle Diamond Tests </p>
      <p class="style1">Tree machine tools used to ship a circle-diamond test 
        part with every CNC mill to prove that the machine performed to spec. 
        The part looked something like this:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/CircleDiamond.jpg" width="256" height="231"> 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It's an interesting looking test, and one 
        I had never seen much written about. I recently did find <a href="http://www.mds-laser.com/renishaw/circlediamondsquare.html">a 
        brief article describing the test</a> that I found interesting. Low and 
        behold the circle-diamond test is an official government test that machines 
        used to have to pass for aerospace work. The test is called &quot;NAS 
        979&quot;, where NAS is an acronym for &quot;National Aerospace Standard&quot;. 
        Interesting!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The NAS 979 test is designed to measure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>5 Deg ramp and .005" taper cuts:<br>
          Uniformity of servo response and slide way stiction by visual inspection 
          of the surface finish. 
        <li>Outside Square surface for:<br>
          Dimensional accuracy, flatness, squareness, parallelism, and Surface 
          Finish. 
        <li>5 Deg Ramp for: Angular deviation 
        <li>The circle:<br>
          Dimensional accuracy, roundness, diameter variation, and finish 
        <li>The center 45Deg Canted square:<br>
          Dimensional accuracy, squareness, parallelism and surface finish </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="style1">It's supposed to be a pretty complete test of a milling 
        machine, so sometime I may try to get together some g-code for it. As 
        originally concieved, it is supposed to be cut from a 14&quot; x 14&quot; 
        x 2&quot; block of aluminum, so I may try something a little smaller! 
      </p>
      <p class="style1">Now let's fast forward to the invention that has replaced 
        the circle-diamond test, something called a &quot;ballbar&quot;:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/ballbar.gif" width="278" height="270"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Ball Bar: Precision linear measurement 
        held between 2 spheres...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The ballbar was invented in the mid-80's 
        at Lawrence Livermore Labs and consists of a precision linear transducer 
        held between two spheres--one in the spindle and one on the table. The 
        transducer tells the ballbar computer software whether the two spheres 
        are moving closer or futher apart as the machine moves through a series 
        of circles around the fixed sphere on the table. A ballbar can determine 
        the following:</p>
      <p><strong>Control Loop Errors</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Servo Mismatch</strong><br>
          Servo mismatch occurs when the servo loop gains of the axes are mismatched, 
          resulting in one axis leading the other causing an oval shaped plot. 
          The leading axis is the axis with the higher loop gain. 
        <li><strong>Reversal Spikes</strong><br>
          When an axis is being driven in one direction and then has to reverse 
          and move in the opposite direction, instead of reversing instantaneously, 
          it may pause momentarily at the turnaround point, causing a &lsquo;Spike' 
          to appear in the plot, and a flat on the work piece. 
        <li><strong>Back Lash or lost motion</strong><br>
          This is usually associated with excess clearance within the drive system, 
          or guide way mechanism. 
        <li><strong>Cyclic errors</strong><br>
          Often associated with badly worn/manufactured, drive system elements 
          like Ball Screws and nut, rack and pinions and their encoder devices. 
        <li><strong>Scaling Error</strong><br>
          Indicates the linear accuracy relationship between two axes within the 
          test area. The Ballbar software provides linear accuracy values to help 
          determine whether each of two axes are unequal and/or correct, due to 
          either servo positioning or slides way mechanical errors. </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Axis Slide Way Errors</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Squareness</strong><br>
          When one axis of motion is not at 90 degrees to the other. 
        <li><strong>Straightness</strong><br>
          Measures any deviation in the axis of motion from a nominal straight 
          line, within the test length. 
        <li><strong>Lateral Play</strong> (slop)<br>
          This comes from excess clearance in the axis guide way system, allowing 
          sideways motion of the element or table as it changes direction. A common 
          cause of lateral play may be excessive gibb clearance. 
        <li><strong>Stick &ndash; Slip and Vibration</strong><br>
          These errors result from poor isolation and/or damping from either internally 
          generated or externally induced disturbances, which cause an axis to 
          move erratically. Potential surface finish problems are identified by 
          the Ballbar through the vibration and/or stick-slip characteristics, 
          but these represent only a small portion of the likely sources of poor 
          surface finish on machined components.<br>
          <br>
          The spindle and it's bearings, along with the cutter/work piece interaction 
          are two primary sources of vibration, in addition to work piece material, 
          configuration, clamping, and process details such as cutter feeds and 
          speeds. While Renishaw Ballbar plots clearly illustrate many of the 
          potential problems affecting part surface finish, the software does 
          not actually diagnose or provide a calculated value for vibration. 
        <li><strong>Positional Tolerance</strong><br>
          This is a calculated estimate of the likely, bi-directional, positioning 
          capability of the two axes within the test area. This true position 
          calculation makes use of the diagnosed values for backlash; scaling 
          error; cyclic error; straightness; squareness and lateral play. </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Pretty nifty device, eh? Shops use the ballbar 
        as a way of tracking their machine performance, anticipating when maintenance 
        may be required, diagnosing machine problems, and providing documentation 
        to customers that their machines are in working order. </p>

        Bearings for Ballscrews and Spindles </p>
      <p class="style1">Without ball bearings of various types, machine tools 
        would be impossible. Their most critical applications involve ballscrew 
        mounting and spindles. Unfortunately, these very same critical applications 
        often call out for very expensive bearings that are out of reach for hobby 
        class machine work. I have a confession to make:<strong> I harbor a deep 
        resentment for those expensive &quot;machine tool quality&quot; angular 
        contact bearings. </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">It may be an unreasonable resentment from some perspectives. 
        NCCams over on CNCZone will tell you all day long that you get what you 
        pay for and you have to buy the most expensive bearings you can't afford, 
        but my resentment leads me to wonder whether it is all really necessary. 
        Yes, if I'm building a vertical machining center with micron accuracy 
        that's capable of 600 ipm rapids, I'm sure they're necessary. NCCams has 
        built a precision machine used to make camshafts for NASCAR winning seems, 
        surely a very exacting application, and one that needed great bearings. 
        But do I really need those costly bearings to do an <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">6K 
        rpm spindle for a hobby mill</a>? Do I need them for a ballscrew bearing 
        block on a machine I hope will be repeatable to a thousandth? I feel the 
        resentment is reasonable for the hobby machines. Someone needs to speak 
        for them! </p>
      <p class="style1">There are tantalizing clues about this conundrum that 
        I run across from time to time, and it always perks up my interest. Some 
        examples:</p>
      <p class="style1">- I am told by various sources that garden variety bearings 
        of today are every bit as accurate as the machine tool quality bearings 
        of the 40's and 50's.</p>
      <p class="style1">- Many Asian-built machines such as the Tormach mills 
        do not use ABEC7 bearings, they get by on lesser grades. </p>
      <p class="style1">- See my blog post below &quot;When the wrong bearings&quot; 
        wherein I explore the use of multiple deep groove bearings to achieve 
        levels of stiffness comparable to angular contact bearings. I can't see 
        why 4 of these dirt cheap bearings couldn't be made to perform like $400-600 
        worth of expensive AC bearings. This article is also copied on the <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">belt 
        drive page</a>. </p>
      <p class="style1">- See my notes on the <a href="CCMillBeltDrive.html">belt 
        drive page</a> about how to go about hand fitting unmatched bearing pairs 
        to be preloaded duplex pairs. </p>
      <p class="style1">- I constantly see examples where machinists are able 
        to get superior performance from worn out or inferior machinery because 
        they know the right tricks. Why can't that be true here too? </p>
      <p class="style1">All of this will sound like a lot of sour grapes belly 
        aching on costs and snake oil selling to those professionals who think 
        nothing of just specing the expensive bearings designed to do the job. 
        They may be right, but I have a sneaking suspicion there is more to it 
        than this. Why might the professionals use expensive bearings if cheaper 
        ones would do? I can think of several reasons.</p>
      <p class="style1">First, look at it from the standpoint of manufacturing 
        repeatability. Machine tools have to be warranted to certain performance 
        levels despite variations in their construction and component parts. Tightening 
        up the specs on the components makes it less likely the tolerances will 
        stack up poorly and a machine will leave the line that isn't up to specs. 
        The science of Six Sigmas and quality control will tell you it is cheaper 
        to set up the manufacturing process to avoid these mistakes in the first 
        place rather than find them after the machines are built and have to rework 
        the out of spec machines. So the overall cost to mass produce a machine 
        may be less while the individual cost of a single machine may be more.</p>
      <p class="style1">Second, consider the warranty aspects and especially durability 
        and wear considerations. An expensive machine tool sold for production 
        business use will be expected to run tirelessly around the clock day after 
        day in order to justify its cost. A hobby or light use machine need not 
        be so durable in order to fulfill its purpose. Also, for many manufacturers, 
        the warranty cost of a failure is very expensive to cure. The cost to 
        an individual to fix their hobby machine themselves may be so much lower 
        they're much more willing to risk it. I read somewhere on CNCZone of a 
        fellow running a CNC router shop that uses hardware store routers and 
        buys crates of bearings for them. He says it costs about $2.50 to replace 
        each bearing and he gets 100 hours of continuous routing from a bearing. 
        To him it is worth it to keep on replacing cheap bearings. To Haas, who 
        sold you a very much more expensive gantry router and a warranty that 
        causes them to have to send someone out to fix your bearings if they break, 
        it isn't worth it.</p>
      <p class="style1">Third, commercial machines have a radically different 
        performance envelope than hobby machines. We kid ourselves we can do what 
        they do, but we can't. We may be able to get a part made that is very 
        close, but it will take us much longer to do it. We don't run nearly the 
        rapids, we often run steppers instead of servos, cutting loads are probably 
        much less, we are babying our cutters and our machines, while the pros 
        are cranking out 110% on the spindle load meters and creating so many 
        chips our little home shops would be buried in no time if we tried it 
        (not to mention all the other problems!). What we really care about most 
        in these hobby class machines is accuracy and repeatability, and not all 
        that much of that. Maybe someday the cutting speeds and efficiencies will 
        matter to us, but for now, we'd just like to get the parts made reliably 
        to a thousandth or so. I submit that this is a far simpler requirement 
        than what most of these high end expensive bearings are being designed 
        to deliver, and that we can therefore get by on less. The level of accuracy 
        and performance needed to cut precision cams to be used in zillion dollar 
        NASCAR racing may be a touch more than what we really need to build tabletop 
        steam engines. </p>
      <p class="style1">Lastly, there is a labor intensiveness factor that matters 
        more to the manufacturer and less to the hobbyist (or to the Asian manufacturer 
        for that matter!). If I am a hobbyist, I can take the time needed to take 
        two relatively unmatched angular contact bearings and grind them for a 
        desired preload. I can then hand fit them to the shafts and bores they'll 
        live in, lapping, honing, or using whatever means is necessary to achieve 
        a good result. If an experiment of this kind is marginal or fails, I can 
        always try again and perhaps do better the second time. Most of the investment 
        I have in is just time. OTOH, if I am a manufacturer, unless my labor 
        is extremely cheap, I want no part of that process. I will spend quite 
        a bit of premium to buy a matched pair of preloaded AC bearings off the 
        shelf so I don't have to mess with grinding them and trial and error. 
        A really fancy set of these bearings is maybe $800. It takes surprisingly 
        little shop time for someone to run up $800 of labor, and they may screw 
        it up! If I just buy the bearings, they're guaranteed and someone else 
        takes the risk for the screw ups. Hence I just buy the bearings if I'm 
        a manufacturer. Things were not always this way. Bridgeport used to hand 
        fit spindle bearings, for example. Not because it made a better mill, 
        but because it was cheaper than buying more expensive bearings at the 
        labor rates in those days. </p>
      <p class="style1">Along comes another member with the same machine who bought 
        a cheap pair of unmatched AC bearings off eBay for $35. He got after them 
        with a surface grinder to grind the inner races to create a preload condition, 
        installed them on his machine, and measured 0.0008&quot; play while still 
        being able to turn the ballscrew relatively freely (too much preload will 
        make the screw stiff and there will be a tradeoff between less play and 
        too much stiffness). Backlash of 0.0008&quot; would be fine for hobbyists 
        wanting to machine with 0.001&quot; accuracy. The price is right and a 
        small amount of labor delivered this happy ending. Would a manufacturer 
        do it this way? They probably would in China, but not from one of the 
        &quot;big name&quot; machine builders they wouldn't! </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Computer Upgrade Time</p>
      <p class="style1">I dread upgrading because everything stops working for 
        a little while. However, this is a good time for me to find the hours 
        needed, it's been 3 years so machines have gotten a lot faster, and AMD 
        recently put some big price cuts on their CPU's. That being said, I just 
        ordered up a new set of &quot;guts&quot; (I like to keep reusing my custom

            <p>AMD and Intel periodically trade places for the speed champ, with 
              Intel usually offering a slightly faster chip for a lot more money.

              motherboards, so I bought this disk to use to back up the other 
              two so I can then bring them up on the new mobo. It will take some 
              backing and forthing, but I gotta have that RAID speed. When I'm 
              done, this disk will remain to use for nightly backups. </p>

      <p class="style1">These goodies, plus the power supply, DVD-R/W, and other 
        bits and pieces in my current machine should give me quite an upgrade 
        in performance. That will free up my current machine's guts to trickle 
        down and improve my kid's machines. Isn't it funny how it always costs 
        right around $1000 to do the PC upgrade you'd like to do? </p>
      <p class="style1">I plan to buy another machine before too long to use for 
        my CNC mill conversion. I think a Shuttle PC will fit inside the NEMA

        I won't tackle that until the main machine has been upgraded! </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">A Fellow GRex Rack Mounter! </p>
      <p class="style1">I came across this fellow's thread on CNCZone and felt 
        a kindred spirit. His rack system is pretty similar to my <a href="MTLatheCNCDrivers.htm">CNC 
        lathe's rack chassis</a>:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/GRexRackCase.jpg" width="800" height="453"> 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">There are several features of his case that 
        I really like. First, It was definitely simpler to just mount the Geckos 
        to the wall rather than use the heatsink I did. Second, I like bringing 
        out the fuses with pilots to the front panel for all axes. I think adding 
        a disable switch to each axis would be nice as well, though it wouldn't 
        get used an awful lot. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The GRex is so powerful and compact, you 
        can fit a lot into one of these small cases! </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Network Connectivity to the Shop </p>
      <p class="style1">Networks and printers usually make for a frustrating day 
        working on computers. Getting network connectivity down to my shop was 
        no exception. I decided to try to do it wirelessly, thinking this would 
        be easier than dealing with cables. So, I bought a wireless router at 
        Staples and a USB wireless connection for the shop computer and I was 
        off to the races. I had only a modicum of the usually nuisances that accompany 
        this sort of job. For example, the &quot;Quick Start&quot; software that 
        came with the router to make it easier completely failed to work. I don't 
        think I've ever seen a network &quot;Quick Start&quot; utility that did 
        work, which seems pretty ridiculous in this day and age. In any event, 
        I had wireless down to the shop and I could log into my network from my 
        shop computer. The chief advantage to this was not having to schlepp g-code 
        files from the CAM program in my office down to the machines. </p>
      <p class="style1">Having crossed this hurdle without singing too many tail 
        feathers, I thought, &quot;Why not keep going and get the lathe's GRex 
        to run via the shop computer?&quot; Capital idea! I had, unfortunately, 
        screwed up royally in my approach. You see, the wireless modem on the 
        shop computer plugs into its USB port and the GRex wants a CAT5 connector. 
        Back to staples looking for a wireless guzinta (because I need something 
        that guzinta that kind of jack). No such animal. How about Radio Shack? 
        Never heard of it. Back home, I went to look at NewEgg. By now it seemed 
        that nobody had thought it would ever be a good idea to take a wireless 
        connection back into a CAT5. How silly is that?!??</p>
      <p class="style1">I don't give up too easily on these network jobs. If you 
        show fear or weakness, you're done for on this kind of thing. So, I started 
        reading up on the Belkin web site, that being the brand of wireless router 
        I had purchased, and discovered it has a &quot;Wireless Access Point&quot; 
        mode. Great! This must mean I can extend my wireless reach with a second 
        router and it would have plenty of nice CAT5 plugs on the back. Back to 
        Staples and a new box was had. More configuration conundrums. As soon 
        as I configured the second router as an Access Point, the PC immediately 
        quit being able to communicate with it in any way shape or form. Drat!!!!!</p>
      <p class="style1">I went through the hard reset process with it about 4 
        times before deciding that was for the birds. Out came a big long cable 
        with CAT5 connectors on either end. I plugged that into a distant connection, 
        ran it all the way to the shop, and plugged it into a cheap 8 port switch. 
        I plugged computer and GRex into that switch, booted the computer and 
        low and behold I was connected! I did the usual little back and forth 
        between Mach 3 and the GRex before they were willing to communicate (just 
        one retry, no biggie), and all was well. </p>
      <p class="style1">Why didn't I do things the simple way to start with? Sigh...</p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Debugging the Lathe Electronics</p>
      <p class="style1">Having gotten things connected down in the shop via LAN, 
        nothing would do but that I needed to fire up the stepper motors for the 
        lathe and verify I could spin the shafts under Mach control. Why? Well 
        why not??? I'd seen this work before, but under much more experimental 
        circumstances in my office and not down in the shop. If I could make it 
        work in the shop, I could bolt the cover on, stick it in the rack next 
        to the computer, and get going finishing off the lathe.</p>
      <p class="style1">Alas, this was just not an easy day. It's funny, but I 
        must have carried over some bad vibes from that last Friday the 13th or 
        something. I hit the jog keys in Mach 3 and nothing. I could at least 
        see the proper axes were lighting their LEDs on the GRex, so I know I 
        had everything good to that point. What gives???</p>
      <p class="style1">Out came the multimeter and I started tracing down how 
        far the AC was getting to the DC power supply. The answer was, &quot;Not 
        very far.&quot; Doh! By this time it was 9 o'clock in the evening, so 
        I shut down the shop and came upstairs to write this little missive. I 
        suppose progress was made, but it certainly seemed minute. Still, it can't 
        be all that hard to track that AC down and figure out what's gone wrong.

      <p class="BlogTitle">Dropping Out Parts in CNC </p>
      <p class="style1">Let's say you're making a part that is going to be machined 
        all the way around. How do you make sure it drops out nicely from the 
        stock without hanging up on the cutter?</p>
      <p class="style1">For example, let's take my EZ-Clamp design:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/MiniRouter/EZClamp/P3243879.JPG" width="800" height="641"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I want to machine the clamp so it is as thick 
        as the stock. How do I make it drop out?</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Several options:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Machine it to partial depth and then flip 
        it over and clamp it in soft jaws for the vise that are machined with 
        a &quot;negative image&quot; of the part. This method does require production 
        of the softjaws, and so is perhaps better suited to production of more 
        than one part. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- If there is a hole, bolt the part down 
        to a fixture and machine away everything but the part and the fixture.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Leave some tabs 0.010&quot; thick that 
        hold the part but that are easy to file through and then sand off. Apparently 
        Mastercam has a feature to put the tabs in automatically. I believe some 
        of the VCarve programs will too. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Machine the part on the end of a piece 
        of round stock and then part it off on the lathe. It will be helpful if 
        the depth you cut the part is a little greater than required. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Clamp half the part with 2 clamps. Machine 
        the part that is free of clamps. Shift the clamps to the other side one 
        clamp at a time. Finish machining. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">- Consider super glue and double sided tape. 
        These can work if the cutting forces and vibration are not too great. 
      </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Proper Installation of Precision Dowel Pins </p>
      <p class="style1">I recently bought some precision dowels on sale somewhere 
        to use for locating parts. You shouldn't be using bolts to locate parts, 
        they're simply there to act as fasteners. Use dowel pins to precisely 
        locate parts. The trick in having them work precisely is in how you make 
        the holes to receive the pins. So, I went out and tracked down <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/topic/30/482.html">a 
        thread that talks about it</a>. There's always a thread to be found on 
        the Internet! </p>
      <p class="style1">I will spare you the reading of the thread by cutting 
        to the chase. There are 2 preferred methods. The first will be a little

      <p class="style1">The second method, which is more accurate but also slower, 
        is to use a boring head.</p>
      <p class="style1">Consider metric sizes for the undersized endmill. For 
        example, 6mm is 0.2362&quot;, which is a reasonable undersize for 0.250&quot;.</p>
      <p class="style1">If the fit is really crucial and you can drill the pin 
        bores all the way through, consider clamping the parts in their proper 
        alignment and machining the dowel bores in a single operation. You can 
        go back and oversize ream one of the two holes for clearance. </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Unusual Edge Finding Accessories: Toolmaker's Chairs 
      </p>
      <p class="style1">Edge finders are important gadgets to have so you can 
        make sure your mill is lined up on a particular feature. Normally, they 
        are just little gizmos you stick in the spindle that work either electronically 
        or mechanically. The classic design spins and when it just touches the 
        edge it &quot;kicks out&quot; to tell you that you've found that edge. 
      </p>
      <p class="style1">There are more elaborate schemes available, however. SPI 
        makes a couple of edge finder accessories that are called &quot;Toolmaker's 
        Chairs&quot;. They look like this:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/Tooling/SPIChairs.gif" width="150" height="150"> 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">As you can tell, they have embedded magnets 
        to hold them in place, and they are precision ground to 0.0001&quot;! 
        You use them to precisely locate using a dial test indicator. To find 
        a corner, the chair on the left is places on the corner and then you indicate 
        on the circular hole that is precisely centered over the corner. To indicate 
        on an edge, use the slotted tool and your DTI. </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Interesting Lathe Modification: Headstock Tramming 
        Screws </p>
      <p class="style1">I came across one of the more unusual lathe modifications 
        I've seen in a long time on CNCZone. This fellow has added setscrews that 
        bear against the 4 mounting bolts for the headstock of his Asian minilathe 
        so that he can tram the headstock for more accurate results:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/OthersProjects/HeadstockTram.JPG" width="756" height="530"></p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Allen wrench is used to adjust 
        the tram...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It's an intriguing idea, but I wonder how 
        well it works in practice? It seems like he is just cocking the head on 
        the V-shaped ways, which would have to introduce some odd side effects, 
        reducing rigidity at the least. OTOH, someone else on the thread opined 
        as how this is a standard feature for some 9x20 lathes from the factory. 
        Perhaps the 9x20's don't sit on the V-shaped ways? Another remarked that 
        its important to torque the main bolts carefully, constantly rechecking 
        alignments lest they be knocked out again. I will also add that I read 
        some posts on CNCZone by Widgitmaster that shows his Birmingham 14x40 
        lathe has bolts similar to what this fellow is using for headstock alignment. 
      </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I had heard a better way to approach this 
        problem is to <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/topic/1/27872.html">first 
        level the lathe and then apply controlled twist the bed</a> to counteract 
        whatever the remaining errors are. One fellow in that thread claims this 
        was the &quot;official&quot; approach advocated by Warner Swasey for their 
        lathes, and certainly a number of the fellows I've come to respect are 
        very supportive of this approach. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">At some point I mean to try the bed adjustment. 
        I want to go through a full &quot;accurizing&quot; process with my lathe 
        after I get the CNC conversion completed to see what the maximum level 
        of performance is that its capable of. FWIW, folks on the aforementioned 
        bed twisting (sorry, trying to humorous) thread feel that taper of less 
        than a thousandth over 6&quot; on a piece with reasonable diameter so 
        it won't flex is fine. <a href="http://www.practicalmachinist.com/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi/topic/2/298.html?#000002">The 
        factory specification for Monarch 10EE</a>'s was 30 millionths of taper 
        in 2&quot; of length. That's 0.000030&quot;! </p>

      <p class="BlogTitle">Cutting T-Slots in Cast Iron for Machine Tables </p>
      <p class="style1">My <a href="CCLatheCNCGangSlide.html">Gang Tool Slide</a> 
        for the lathe is going to require me to cut T-slots, so I went poking 
        around and came up with some tips on cutting T-slots and cast iron. </p>
      <p class="style1">First thing is you'll need a T-slot cutter. These are 
        special milling cutters made for the purpose of cutting the bottom extra 
        wide area and they're not cheap! </p>
      <p class="style1">Here is what one looks like:</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"><img src="img/CNCCookbook/T_slotCutter.jpg" width="250" height="112"></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Note the unusual staggered tooth pattern. 
        It's designed to help pass the chips through the confined spaces of the 
        T-slot. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Okay, given the requisite cutters, the first 
        task will be to square the cast iron piece if you haven't done so already. 
        The Fidgiting Widgitmaster makes these T-slot tables for a living, and 
        has recommended that when roughing cast iron, one should use low rpm and 
        high feed rates. Within the limits of my machine's HP ratings, my 3&quot; 
        indexable face mill could be used at 764 rpm, 20 ipm, and 0.050&quot; 
        depth of cut. The Widgitmaster goes on to suggest that for a fine finish, 
        try a 0.005&quot; depth of cut and slow feed. I'm thinking I'll use my 
        newly purchased big fly cutter to do this job. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Next step is to rough cut the table slot 
        with a regular square end mill. You need to make the slot wide enough 
        to allow clearance for the T-slot cutter's shank, but it need not be much 
        wider than that. Some folks like to cut the table slot so it will be a 
        little deeper than the T-slot's bottom. The allows extra clearance for 
        the T-bolts so they don't jam up as easily. It also reduces the likelihood 
        the T-cutter will dig in. All in all, it seems a good idea to me. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Having roughed in the table slot, the next 
        step is to run the T-slot cutter. These cutters have a hard life--you 
        can't sneak up on the cut at all, they have to cut full width and they 
        have to do the job down in a hole. Be sure to make arrangements to clear 
        the chips down in that hole! I'm told most people prefer to cut cast iron 
        without coolant, so one could use compressed air, but a shop vac rigged 
        up to suck out the chips seems an even better idea and will keep from 
        spreading nasty cast iron dust all over the shop. I'm also thinking I 
        want to run that T-slot cutter without touching the Y-axis at all after 
        having milled the table slot. Feed and speed for the T-slot cutter are 
        interesting. I've heard a recommendation of 1/2 the spindle speed of an 
        equivalent sized end mill but much faster feedrate because of all the 
        teeth.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">The last step is to do the finish cuts on 
        the table slot. You want these to be well finished and true, so now is 
        the chance to cut only on one side instead of full width. Take care the 
        slot stays well centered on the T-slot and use optimal finishing speeds 
        and feeds for the cast iron as well as a nice sharp 4 flute end mill. 
      </p>
      <p class="BlogTitle">Lifting Heavy Fixtures and Tooling </p>
      <p class="style1">Lifting heavy tooling and fixtures such as vises, chucks, 
        or rotary tables can be difficult. I've come across several aids in my 
        travels that I thought I would share. First is this nifty vise caddy that 
        I have added to my <a href="CCWishListFutures.htm">project to do list</a>:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/MillViseSwingArm1.jpg" width="512" height="384"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/OthersProjects/MillViseSwingArm2.jpg" width="512" height="384"></p>
      <p class="style1">Isn't that cool? It's a copy and somewhat nicer looking 
        version of a gizmo that SPI sells for almost $400. Attaches to the base 
        of your mill and then you can move your vise on and off the table easily. 
        I could see keeping a shelf back behind the mill that is accessible via 
        this arm.</p>
      <p class="style1">Next I have a tip for owners of larger lathes wanting 
        to change chucks. It doesn't come with pictures, unfortunately. The suggestion 
        is to chuck up a suitable section of pipe, place a block of wood on the 
        ways to act as a fulcrum, and then use the pipe to lever the chuck off 
        the lathe and over to where it's going. If you keep your chucks standing 
        on edge you can simply chuck the next one onto the pipe and use the same 
        strategy to manuever it back onto the lathe. You should probably use aluminum 
        pipe or conduit to avoid gouging your spindle with the end. </p>
      <p class="style1">How is this for a portable lifting gadget for moving fixtures 
        and tooling on and off the mill tables? It was created by a machinist 
        on CNCZone named Geof:</p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">That seems like a pretty handy doodad. It 
        is set up to straddle the mill base on his Haas VMC's. Geof is not done 
        with tricks yet, however. Consider this tidy installation on his Mini-Mill:</p>

        a tooling plate...</p>

        4th axis hangs from a turnbuckle. Once the vises are out of the way, it

        or, How You Can Make A Mill from a Drillpress </p>
      <p class="style1">Any casual reader of CNCZone will eventually run across 
        one of the famous bearing rants for either spindles or ballscrew mounting. 
        Closely allied are the drill press mill rants. <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34883">Some 
        noob will inquire with much enthusiasm how to go about converting the 
        Asian drill press they just got for $39.95 into a CNC mill</a> capable 
        of slicing through solid green kyrptonite at 300 ipm with an accuracy 
        of 10 microns and the old hands will just come unglued at the absurdity 
        of it all. While this can be entirely entertaining to watch, one does 
        feel a bit like the beginners are receiving an initiation flogging they 
        don't really deserve and are ill-equipped to understand. </p>
      <p class="style1">The bearing question is similar. Someone wants to mount 
        a ballscrew or spindle in &quot;ABEC7&quot; skate bearings that were purchased 
        cheaply on eBay and the ranting from the old hands starts in again. <a href="http://www.cnczone.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20748&highlight=20tac47">Pretty

        and everyone wonders how we got there. </p>
      <p class="style1">What's funny is that every now and again, someone actually

        is a Mech E professor that has built a <a href="http://www.pathcom.com/~vhchan/cnc/cnc.html">pretty 
        nice little milling machine from a drill press</a>: </p>

      <p align="center" class="style1"><strong>You too can build a milling machine 
        from a drill press...</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Someone commented that this design was a 
        nightmare and the guy obviously didn't know what he was doing because 
        he had installed 5 deep groove ball bearings and a single tapered bearing 
        that was in backwards of all things. You just can't do that--it ain't 
        right!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">&quot;Hmmm,&quot; says I. When I hear that 
        you can't do something, I kind of want to know why the guy did it anyway 
        and how well it worked. It occured to me that perhaps this guy was clever 
        like a fox. I sniffed around his site a bit more and learned he was a 
        Professor of Mechanical Engineering with full Piled Higher and Deeper 
        credentials. Now I am nto one who is intimidated by credentials having 
        attended graduate school and met many of these sort of fellows. At the 
        same time I do not immediately assume any PhD is an idiot either. This 
        guy piled on 5 deep groove and 1 upside down tapered roller bearing for 
        a reason, and it became my mission to figure it out.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It didn't take me too long to decide that 
        maybe he was just stacking the bearings to make up for their inherent 
        weaknesses. One often hears about stacking 3 or even 4 angular contact 
        bearings to increase rigidity. So I dragged out my bearing catalogs and 
        had a look at what this might mean.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">From the NSK bearing catalog I found a nice 
        comparison of the strengths of various kinds of bearings. We can see that 
        deep groove bearings are primarily limited in that their load capacity 
        is not as good as angular contact bearings:</p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">So I decided to try to set up a comparison 
        of the radial and axial load capacities for similar sized bearings of 
        different types. There are formulas in the NSK catalog that may be used 
        to compute the load capacity of up to 4 stacked bearings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double:&nbsp; 1.62x Radial, 2xAxial</li>
        <li> Triple:&nbsp; 2.15xRadial, 3xAxial</li>
        <li> Quadruple:&nbsp; 2.64xRadial, 4xAxial</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="style1">You can see that axial loads are additive 
        but radial loads don't get 4x the value when you stack 4 bearings. In 
        fact they aren't even 3x as strong radially when 4 bearings are stacked. 
        That's going to be the weakpoint I suspect. The results are interesting. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Multiple 6204&rsquo;s Back to Back</strong></p>
      <p class="style1">6204's are standard deep groove ball bearings, typically 
        considered wholly unsuitable for spindle and ballscrew use. You can buy 
        plain vanilla 6204's for $7.69 apiece while ABEC7 quality 6204's are $77. 
        Here's what you can get by stacking them: </p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">So how do they compare to equivalent angular 
        contact bearings?</p>
      <p><strong>7204&rsquo;s</strong></p>
      <p class="style1"> The plain vanilla angular contact equivalent of a 6204 
        is simply a 7204. Your basic 7204 costs $23.88 so already we could have 
        bought 3 6204's for the price of a single 7204 and for two 7204's we can 
        surely stack up our 4 6204's. A matched duplex pair of ABEC7 7204's are 
        a cool $200. </p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">Guess what? The double AC bearing configuration 
        is bested by a triple 6204 bearing arrangement! Now if we want ABEC7's, 
        the duplex AC bearings are still a bit cheaper, but if we're fooling with 
        more &quot;stock&quot; bearings, it seems like we can get a more rigid 
        arrangement for less money using the deep groove bearings.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">I'm sure it is probably not quite so easy, 
        but it is certainly intriguing. It wouldn't cost much to build a test 
        rig and see how well the deep grooves perform when stacked. Now I'm sure 
        the bearing gurus are spinning up to full whirling dervish speed to jump 
        all over this concept, but I remain unrepentant until I see someone hook 
        them up and make them play.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style1"><strong>What about the really expensive bearings?</strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">A duplex pair of the much vaunted 20TAC47B 
        purpose-built for ballscrews angular contact bearings turns in an axial 
        load value of 26,600N. That's better than 3 stacked 7204's! However, note 
        that the quadruple 6204's begins to approach this value at 26,400N. Also 
        note that 20TAC47B's cost $800 the pair. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">Can 4 of these cheap bearings do ballscrew 
        duty as well as the $800 TAC's? That's a scary thing to spring on the 
        bearing gurus. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style1">It remains to be seen, but I would sure love 
        to try the experiment someday! </p>

      <p align="left" class="style1">No, but it would have been an appropriate 
        post to keep people guessing. </p>
